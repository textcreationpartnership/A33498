            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Holy wiſe Omnipotent God, having by his Power appeared, and manifeſted himſelf unto a Remnant of People, in the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> who were ſcattered up and down the Barren Mountains, ſeeking reſt, but finding none; the Lord in a wonderful manner did break in upon them, and by his Power did rend the Vail of Darkneſs that was over them, and did Purge and Purifie them; and after he had thus fitted, and prepared a People for his Praiſe, his Power moved ſtrongly in the Hearts of many,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93507:3"/>
and his Pure Love conſtrained them, to leave dear and near Relations, to declare unto others what the Lord had done for their Souls; in the Year 1654. ſeveral of God's faithful Servants, were moved of their <hi>Maſter and Lord,</hi> to travel into the Southern Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome into the Weſtern Parts. The chief of which that were the firſt Proclaimers of this Heavenly Meſſage in and about <hi>Briſtol,</hi> were <hi>theſe two true and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God John Audland, and John Cam;</hi> by whoſe powerful Miniſtry many were convinced, and turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from Satan's Power to God; amongſt whom was our dear Brother <hi>Joſiah Coale;</hi> The Powerful Word of Life (declared and preached by God's Servant <hi>John Audland)</hi> did pierce and break his Heart, and took deep root in him, and wrought effectually to his Salvation and Redemption: He was for a Time under <hi>deep Judgement, and walked mournfully many a day,</hi> whereby he became a Wonder, and a gaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Stock, unto thoſe that were his former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; and <hi>he,</hi> amongſt the reſt of the Lord's People, was Reproached, and Mocked, Reviled, and Perſecuted; but <hi>God's Arm that was revealed and made bear was ſtrong, and wrought powerfully in him, and rent the Vail of Darkneſs, and pluckt up the Weeds
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93507:3"/>
and evil Plants,</hi> which the <hi>Enemy</hi> had ſown in his Heart, and purified and purged his Veſſel, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it fit for the Lord's uſe: <hi>So the Lord opened the Spring of Life and Fountain of Love in his Soul, which gave him full ſatisfaction, and cauſed his Cup to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow;</hi> and being thus <hi>Tranſlated out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God,</hi> paſſing through the Miniſtration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, bearing daily the Croſs of Chriſt, he obtained Life and Salvation <hi>through the Grace of Chriſt that wrought in him,</hi> and being made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker <hi>of the Divine Nature,</hi> and the Love of God ſhed abroad in his Heart (the nature of which makes the Heart tender) by its Vertue and Power he was moved and conſtrained to leave his Fathers Houſe, and his near and dear Relations, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, and travelled by Sea through many Dangers, and preached the Goſpel in many of the Weſtern <hi>Iſlands,</hi> and in <hi>Maryland,</hi> and <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> from whence he paſſed through the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> on foot, many hundreds of Miles, to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> amongſt thoſe cruel and bloody Profeſſors, who drunk the Blood of four of the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (only for their pure Teſtimony and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which Blood the Lord will require at their Hands) he preached the Goſpel freely,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93507:4"/>
going a warfare at his own charge; and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord did accompany him, and by his powerful Miniſtry many were convinced, and turned to the Lord: After his long Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in ſeveral Places and <hi>Iſlands</hi> beyond the <hi>Seas,</hi> he came over into his own Native Country (old <hi>England)</hi> where he laboured much in the Work and Service of the Lord, in ſeveral Countries, and was dearly beloved, and well accepted of by all that had a true ſavour of God. After ſome time here in <hi>England,</hi> ſpent chiefly in the Work of God, he travelled again by <hi>Sea</hi> into the ſeveral <hi>Iſlands,</hi> and <hi>Plantations,</hi> to viſit the tender <hi>Seed of God, raiſed by his Power, and to water the tender Plants, which the Lord by his own Right Hand had planted;</hi> and the good preſence of God was with him, and did ſupport him in his Exerciſes and Tryals, and brought him back ſafe into his own Country, though his outward man was much ſpent, and weakned by his ſore Travels and Exerciſes, as many of his dear Friends were ſenſible of, and often told him of it; but his Heart was bent to go on in the Work and Service of the Lord, <hi>being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpend, and be ſpent in ſo weighty and good a Work as the Lord had called him to, it being his Meat and Drink to do the Will of his Father:</hi> He ſuffered Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93507:4"/>
for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, which he held, in ſeveral Places in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Launcſton</hi> in <hi>Cornwel,</hi> in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in <hi>Kendal,</hi> in <hi>Weſt-moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſeveral times in <hi>London;</hi> in all which he was found faithful, and did never yield to the fawning Flatteries of men; but did wait in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till the Lord did make way for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He was endued with a good Meaſure of the <hi>Heavenly Power and Wiſdom of God, which made him bold and valient for the Truth;</hi> and often times full of <hi>Heavenly Majeſty</hi> in his Declaration, which did wound and pierce the Hearts of many, and made them bow before the Lord, and <hi>confeſs to the Truth</hi> which he preached: Thoſe that were intimately acquainted with him, found him to be of a tender ſpirit, and of a ſweet loving diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; greatly delighting in the Union and Society of his Brethren, having an honourable eſteem of thoſe that were in Chriſt before him. Towards the latter end of the ninth Moneth 1668. he began to be ill in Body; but being of a ſtrong ſpirit, he kept over it for ſome time; till at laſt he was forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep his Chamber for ſome weeks, in which time, he was much refreſhed <hi>with the Life and Power of God, which did ariſe in him,</hi> to the comfort and refreſhment of thoſe that did tend him: in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93507:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
midſt of his bodily weakneſs and exerciſes, he was raiſed again for a little time, and walked abroad; but ſoon after (the cauſe of his diſtemper remaining) he was brought down again, and his ſtrength paſſed away by degrees, until a Period was put to his days; he was full of love even to the laſt, and his Heart was broken and melted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; and many times broke forth and praiſed the Lord, and declared much of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God unto him, which did ever melt and tender the Hearts of thoſe that heard him; he paſſed away like a Lamb, without the leaſt Sigh or Groan, even as One falling into a ſweet Sleep, and ſo is at reſt with the Lord, and the Lamb, and all the holy Angels and Saints; and ſhall reſt in peace and joy forevermore (and to convince the Reader, that theſe things teſtified of him, are true) (as many living Witneſſes can ſeal to the ſame) look over his own Writings, and read over his ſeveral Epiſtles, written to the Churches at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, and upon ſeveral Occaſions, which are gathered together and preſented to thy vew, and if thou haſt any true ſpiritual ſence in thee, thou wilt feel and diſcern that <hi>ſuch ſweet and pleaſant Streams muſt needs flow from a ſweet and good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, knowing that one Fountain doth not ſend forth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93507:5"/>
ſweet and bitter Water;</hi> therefore the Streams being ſweet, the Fountain (or Well from whence they ſpring) is ſweet alſo; and he having drunk deep draughts of the Water (that Chriſt gives) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in him a Well of Living Water, ſpringing up into Eternal Life, according to the ſaying of Chriſt our Saviour: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall drink of the Water that I give it ſhall be in him a Well of Living Water, ſpringing up into Eternal Life.</hi> And that this was true in him, is atteſted unto by one, who had large experience of his Integrity, and Holy Zeal for God; who has been often in travels with him, and ſtill is a Labourer in the Lord's Vine-yard, deſiring and praying to Almighty God, that the ſcattered Sheep may be gathered into the Fold of the good Shepherd; <hi>That ſo there may be one Sheep-Fold, and one Shepherd.</hi>

he was freely given up to improve his Gift in the Heavenly Calling wherewith he was called, <hi>to ſpend and to be ſpent for the Goſpel's ſake</hi> (wherein he had his reward) counting nothing too dear of Life, Relation, or Eſtate, to reſign up in and for that Service, wherein he manifeſted both his Commiſſion and Power to be of God, and not of man, for the gathering out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, falſe Wayes, and Worſhips, emty Profeſſions, and vain Traditions of men, into the Light, and Living way of Truth, that therein they might ſerve and worſhip God in Spirit, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no confidence in the Fleſh, nor products thereof.</p>
                  <p>He was a Man of a tender ſpirit, having a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent eſteem of his faithful Brethren and elders in the Truth, and he had a tender care to preſerve U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Brotherly Love; as alſo the ſence he had of his reward, made him chearful in his Service, and fervent in ſpirit, and zealous in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies againſt all falſe and deceitful ſpirits, which ſlight and diſ-eſteem Truth, and lead into Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Unity and Fellowſhip of the Goſpel, whoſe wayes do not tend to Peace, but Strife, and Self-ſeparation.</p>

and preſt the neceſſity of obedience through it, and unto watchfulneſs in the fear of God: He preached Faith in the Power of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, not to ſtand in the wiſdom of man, nor in lifeleſs Profeſſions, or traditional Opinions, nor yet to conſiſt in ſelf acting, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary humility, but in Spirit and Life, from which living Obedience and Righteouſneſs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpring; by which Teſtimony and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was inſtrumental to affect the Hearts of many with the excellency of the Truth, as it is in Jeſus; and turn many thereunto, even from Darkneſs unto Light, and from Satan's Power to God, that they might both receive Remiſſion of ſin, and Poſſeſſion of Life Eternal: And as he had freely received of Chriſt, ſo he freely gave, and as he was freely given up to ſpend, and to be ſpent for the Lord; ſo he ſpared not of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Subſtance in his Service, his care being ſuch (to cut off occaſions from ſuch as ſeek them, and ſo to keep the Goſpel without charge, as that he many times would not uſe his power and freedom which Chriſt allowed his Miniſters in that caſe, as mentioned in <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. but with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> debaſed himſelf, that he might not prove chargable to the Churches, and indeed, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93507:7"/>
went much a warfare at his own charges, giving freely up, both his Liberty and Life for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Goſpel of Truth, both in this, and other <hi>Nations</hi> through many Hazards and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, particularly of late years in this <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> wherein the bleſſed effects of his Labours, Travels, and Sufferings are felt and known by many.</p>
                  <p>And as he lived in and by the Faith of God's Elect, ſo with him to live was Chriſt, and to dye a Gain; who being outwardly ſpent for the Goſpel ſake, was inwardly renewed by the Vertue of the ſame, whereby having conquered Death and the Grave, he chearfully embraced his Diſſolution, and changed for a full and perpetual Injoyment of that Joy and Reward of Life and Glory, which he had long an Earneſt and Evidence of in himſelf; and in the fulneſs of which his Soul now reſts, and lives for evermore; <hi>Yea, his life is felt in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Society; and though he being dead, yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, in whom he died, who is his Reſurrection and Life for evermore.</hi>

and to the repleniſhing of his Soul with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Conſolations.</p>
                  <p>In the Eternal Light I knew him, and had often and ſweet Fellowſhip with him therein to my great refreſhment, <hi>even</hi> in <hi>the gloomy and dark day of my early and deep Exerciſes;</hi> and though he was a man free in his diſpoſition, and ready to help all through the tenderneſs of his ſpirit, yet was he indued with ſound Judgment, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of ſpirits, and giving no liberty to the Fleſh; but was dreadful in his Teſtimony againſt the <hi>Life, Glory and Cuſtomes of the World</hi> (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed therefrom, and made a Witneſs through Judgment of that pure Spirit of Glory, which was before the World began, which vails and darkens the beauty of Fleſh, and gathers into Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Self-denial through the Sanctifying ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſame) I had intimacy with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove many; but ſo mixt was his kindneſs with ſeriouſneſs, and his familiarity with a ſtay'd, and examplary Behaviour, as he was ever an honour to the Truth, and therein a confirmer of his holy Teſtimony, and weaker Brethren.</p>
                  <p>He was an inceſſant Labourer in the Goſpel, and Few more ſpent in its Service; his Soul ſeem'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93507:9"/>
wholly bent to the Renowning of it, and its Enemies he ever accounted his: His Declaration was to the Ungodly World <hi>like an Ax, an Hammer, or a Sword, ſharp and piercing,</hi> being moſtly attended with an eminent appearance of the dreadful Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord, <hi>to the cutting down of many a tall Cedar, and to the making of many lofty Oaks to bow;</hi> but to the Faithful and diligent (who mind the things of Chriſt more then their own) <hi>O the ſoft and pleaſant Streams of Life Immortal, that have run through him to the refreſhing of thoſe the Lord's He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage;</hi> yea, 'twas his life and joy to be ſpeaking the Word of the Lord, and not his own: And many thouſands doubtleſs reſt behind, who are living Teſtimonies to the <hi>Power, Vertue, and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Miniſtry;</hi> but above all terrible was he to the Sowers of Strife, ſecret Back-biters, and ſuch as rend the holy Body, and ſeparate from the Life, Love, and Fellowſhip of the Bleſſed Truth: <hi>Who in their own ſelfiſh ſpirit ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over the holy Brethren, by feignedneſs and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearances, to the betraying of the Simple-hearted, and ketching the Innocent in their Snares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet was he ready to reach out an helping Hand to ſave the upright Hearted, whoſe deſires were to the Lord, and the Fellowſhip of the

Faithful: He was Hardy, Valiant, and fixt, not of thoſe that ſhun the Croſs, or ſell their Birth-right for a Meſs of Pottage.

                  </p>
                  <p>He was a good Example, as well for his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality as Faithfulneſs; for as I am a Witneſs, that the proſperity of God's Truth (and dear Friends) was above all things moſt in his Eye; ſo was he alwayes cautious of making the Goſpel chargeable to any; but having ſome <hi>Eſtate</hi> of his own he freely imploy'd it in the Lord's Service, <hi>counting nothing too dear for the Name and Service of the Lord.</hi>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore ſhall his Memorial remain as a ſweet Oyntment with the Righteous, and time ſhall never blot him out of their remembrance; <hi>for amongſt the Worthies ſhall he be reckoned in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come, becauſe he loved not his Life unto Death,</hi> but chos'd to paſs through the many Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, which have given him an enterance into the Everlaſting Reſt, <hi>where his ſpirit lives and remains with God for ever.</hi>

                  <p>HE did labour much in the Power of the Lord, and did ſtand in the Power of the Lord againſt the ſpirit of the World, and againſt all the Oppoſers of the Truth to his dying day; yea within one Hour and a half of his death (ſee his Teſtimony againſt the dark blaſphemous ſpirit of <hi>Muggleton,</hi> in the latter end of this Book) and beſides the ſeveral Oppoſers of the Truth, of the ſeveral <hi>Sects</hi> in <hi>New-England, Barbadoes, Virginia, Mary-Land,</hi> and other <hi>Iſlands;</hi> and the ſeveral Cruel and Inhumane Sufferings, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments by the chief Prieſts, Profeſſors, and Rulers) which would be to large to mention,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93507:11"/>
and would make a great Volumn, that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them: And alſo his ſore Travels among the <hi>Heathen</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> concerning the Truth, and preaching the Goſpel; and when the cruel murdering Prieſts and Profeſſors of <hi>New-England,</hi> which Murdered, and Martyr'd, and Spoyled ſo many of the Goods of our Friends, and burned ſome of them with their hot Irons, and cut off the Ears of ſome of our Friends for the Truth and Goſpel's ſake. Theſe <hi>New-England</hi> perſecuting Profeſſors ſaid to ſome that they did perſecute; Why did not our Friends come thorow the <hi>Heathen</hi> by Land, from <hi>Virginia</hi> to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> thorow the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> on foot; for they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Miracles: but <hi>Joſiah Coale</hi> and another, was that very Time paſſing thorow the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> from <hi>Virginia</hi> to <hi>New-England:</hi> and the perſecuting Profeſſors of <hi>New-England,</hi> then did not think that they were ſo near them, that did paſs thorow the <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Wilderneſſes,</hi> which immediately came among them: having paſſed thorow the <hi>Woods,</hi> and wilde <hi>Wilderneſſes,</hi> and thorow the danger of the Men-Eaters, and wilde <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and venomous Creatures; but when they came through much Hunger, and Cold, and Wearineſs, through the Bogs and Waters into
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93507:12"/>
                     <hi>New-England,</hi> they found worſs entertainment among the <hi>New-England</hi> perſecuting Prieſts and Profeſſers, then they had found among the wilde and venomous <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and <hi>Men-eaters;</hi> yea, they were worſs to them, and others of the Diſciples of Chriſt (as I ſaid) then the <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Men-eaters;</hi> who had paſſed thorow much danger of their lives, and oft times were fain to cut down <hi>Cheſt-Nut-Trees,</hi> for the Nuts for Food, when they were hungry: And nevertheleſs when theſe came immediatly upon the blind perſecuting Profeſſors in <hi>New-England,</hi> theſe Profeſſors were in as much Unbelief, as ever they were before; as it may appear more at large in the Record of <hi>New-England's</hi> Perſecutions; And alſo this <hi>Joſiah Coale's</hi> Labour and Travels in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> concerning the Goſpel of God, and his Truth; where ever he came he did bear his Teſtimony againſt that ſpirit that did oppoſe the Truth, and he did live to ſee much of it over-thrown: And alſo when this <hi>Joſiah Coale</hi> was weak, the Power of the Lord was freſh in him, and a little before he died, I ſpoke to him, that the Friends that were with him, might go forth of the Room, for I had ſomething to ſay to him, and when they were gone, I asked him, if
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93507:12"/>
that he was clear, or whether any thing did lie upon him to write to Friend in <hi>England,</hi> or any other Parts of the World beyond the <hi>Seas</hi> to Friends; and he ſaid, that he was clear of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, and how that the Lord by his Power and Majeſty, had carried him through <hi>England,</hi> and other <hi>Nations,</hi> and ſo he had nothing to write; but deſired his love might be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to all the Friends, and ſaid, that one thing did lie upon him: He did underſtand that I had a Book in anſwer to <hi>Muggleton,</hi> and that when he was gone, <hi>Muggleton</hi> and his Company would boaſt againſt him; wherefore he deſired that I would put a few words of his laſt Teſtimony againſt <hi>Muggleton</hi> in my Book, and I bade him to write them out, for I was to go to ſee a Friend hard by, and would come to him preſently again, and at that time as he was ſitting in his Chair by the fire, he ſpoke them forth in the Power of the Lord God, as freſh as if he had ayled nothing, and a Friend took it in writing; which Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is inſerted in the latter Part of this Book (as is before noted) After this was done, <hi>Joſiah Coale</hi> deſired me to pray, that he might have an eaſie paſſage; and when I came to him again, he was ſitting by the fire as before, in the Power of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93507:13"/>
Lord, and full of it; and after ſeeing him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be haevy, I bade him to go and lie on the Bed, which he did, and with Friends help roſe up again, and ſate on the ſide of the Bed, and Friends ſate about him, and heal'd him; and I went to him, and heal'd him, and he was full of the Power of the Lord, and his Seed and Life, that was over all; and ſo in that he departed away in the Arms of Friends, as he ſate on the ſide of his Bed; and had a very eaſie paſſage through the Life in which he remaines. His Age when he died was 35. Years and two Moneths, and he was in the Service of the Lord, preaching his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel about twelve Years, and did convince many to the Lord's Truth, and brought many from the vain Rudiments of the World to the Goſpel. You may ſee ſome of his Epiſtles and Writings in this following Book, which he left in writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carefully copied out, and placed together; which is but ſome of what he hath written, and ſpoken.</p>

                  <p>MY dearly beloved Friends, who are oft brought into my Remembrance, and preſented before me by the Spirit of the Lord; with whom my Life is, and unto whom the Love of my ſoul doth even flow forth and extend it ſelf; in the Vertue of that Life which is Infinite and Eternal, and in the Spirit of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation my ſoul is daily pour'd forth unto the Lord, before
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93507:16"/>
the Throne of his Majeſty, on your behalfs; Beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Deſiring, That he will ſo furniſh and arm you with the whole Armour of his own Righteouſneſs, that you may be entire wanting nothing; and that you may be enabled to ſtand, and hold out unto the End in this day of Battel and Tryal; and that, as <hi>Valiant Souldiers</hi> of the Lamb, you may endure (all Hardſhips) as ſeeing him preſent in the midſt of you, who is Inviſible; in the Faith of the Anſwer whereof I dearly ſalute you all.</p>
                  <p>And dear Friends, in this you may all be enboldned (and in this Conſideration your Heads may be lifted up above all Sufferings, even in the midſt of them) that the Cauſe in which you are engag'd, and for which you ſuffer, is a Righteous Cauſe, of which we have the Witneſs or Teſtimony in our own Conſciences; and a more certain Witneſs cannot be: and this Witneſs doth teſtifie, That our Cauſe is the Cauſe of God; who hath call'd us out of Darkneſs into his marvelous Light, and hath made choice of us, to bear <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to (and ſtand Witneſſes for) his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> in this Day of his <hi>Spiritual Appearance,</hi> and Manifeſtation, or Revelation of the Son of his Love; whoſe quickening Spirit we have receiv'd, by which we are ſeperated from the World; and by which we have been (and ſtill are) conſtrain'd to bear Teſtimony againſt all Oppreſſion and Cruelty, and againſt all the Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of this ſinful World; for which Cauſe theſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings come upon us, and attend us: But bleſſed be the Lord, who hath call'd us with ſo Honorable a Calling, and accounted us worthy to ſuffer for ſo Honourable a Cauſe, as, <hi>Our Teſtimony for his Bleſſed Name and Truth:</hi> the Reward thereof (which is great) will be certain unto all who are found Faithful unto the End.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my dear Friends (towards whom my Bowels
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93507:16"/>
of Love even earn, and my Life and Soul reacheth, as you may feel, who are ſenſible of Life) I ſay unto you all, in the Name and Fear of the Lord, Lift up your Heads, over, and above all <hi>Sufferings,</hi> both preſent and to come; I ſay, in the Faith look over them all, unto him who is inviſible, who will out-laſt them all; who alone hath Immortallity, and dwells in the Light; whoſe Preſence is certainly with you and amongſt you, and will be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd as you walk and continue with him in his Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant of Light, in which he dwells: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let your Life, Delight, and Habitation be in him; for, my Friends, you whoſe Hearts are upright unto God, know right well, that the Lord hath not been at any time wanting unto you in any Exerciſe, of what nature or kind ſoever, in time paſt; the conſideration of which is a ſufficient Encouragement to every one, to caſt their Care upon him, and to reſign up themſelves unto him, who takes Care for them. And if the Enemy be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo far to prevail, as to execute his Decrees made againſt us; yet in this may we be all ſatisfied, that it ſhall certainly work for good unto us in the End, and ſhall make for the furtherance of the Glorious Goſpel of Peace, and for the Exaltation of the Worthy Name of the Lord, by which we are call'd; wherefore in Contentedneſs with the Will of the Lord in all ſtates, let every one reſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd up unto him, and in the Gift of his own Spirit wait upon him to receive daily Refreſhment from his Preſence, that you may be Water'd, Refreſhed, and Conſolated from day to day; that ſo you may grow in his Grace, and be kept freſh and living in his precious Truth, to ſhine forth in the beauty thereof. And let it be your great Care above all things, to keep in the Enjoyment and Feeling of the Peace and Love of God in your own Hearts, and in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93507:17"/>
that you will have Content in all Conditions; and live in Love and in Peace one with another, and have perfect Charity amongſt your ſelves: and whatſoever tends to the contrary, let it be condemned by the Light in the riſe of it. And bear with (and for) one another, and watch over one another in Love, and therein exhort one another; and build up one another in the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith, which gives you Victory over the World, and over all the Perſecuting Powers of Darkneſs; and be a Strength, and a Refreſhing, and a Comfort one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your Perſecuted Suffering State and Condition.</p>
                  <p>And God Almighty keep you all, and refreſh your hearts daily with his Love, and renew your ſtrength with the vertue of his Life, that none may be weary, nor faint in your Minds; but that all may endure with Patience, and Valour, and Boldneſs, and Courage, in the Lamb's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto the End; that in the End you may be Crown'd with the Crown of Immortal Life and Glory, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fades away, which is the Daily-Prayer of him who dearly and entirely loves you all, who are of an Upright Heart; by which Love I was conſtrain'd to ſalute you all at this time with theſe few Lines, and ſo reſt in it.</p>

                  <p>MY beloved Friends, Brethren, and Siſters, who are expos'd to Exilement, from the Land of your Nativity, for the ſake of your Teſtimony to the bleſſed Truth of God; and who have been, and are content to ſuffer the loſs of all that were dear unto you in this preſent World, for the ſake of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and rather then to betray that bleſſed Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which God had committed unto you to bear for his Name; and who have ſufficiently manifeſted your fidelity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93507:18"/>
unto the Lord and his bleſſed Truth, even in the view of the whole World (as a Witneſs againſt their Falſe, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, and Idolatrous Worſhips (which God by his Power) will certainly throw down, and bring to nought) and who have bore Teſtimony in Faithfulneſs (in and by your Submiſſiveneſs to an Exil'd Eſtate) againſt that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ſpirit of Perſecution, which Raigns and Rules in the Hearts of all the Apoſtate Falſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whoſe Worſhip ſtandeth in Subjection to the Precepts and Commandments of Men, and in Bowing to Stocks and Stones, and to the Works of Men's Hands, and in other Outward Performances, without the Inward Leadings of the Spirit of the Lord; and in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian-ſpirit (by which they have been exerciſed (in the aforeſaid Idolatrous Abominations) they have been Killing, Deſtroying, and Devouring one another about thoſe things which are their own Inventions, ſet up in their own Wills, which they would have all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to: and have long impoſed it one upon another by Penal Laws, and thereby have enforced many (who fear'd Man more then God) to conform, contrary to what they were perſwaded in their own Conſciences) to worſhip the Image ſet up by them; yet a Remnant there was alwayes, whom God preſerved, and rais'd up by his Power, to ſtand faithful Witneſſes againſt their Idolatrous Worſhips and Traditions, whoſe Blood this Antichriſtian-ſpirit in the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, that carries the <hi>Whore,</hi> hath always drunk; and many Faithful Martyrs of Jeſus, in times paſt, have ſeal'd their Teſtimony againſt this falſe Church of Apoſtate Chriſtians (in which this Antichriſtian ſpirit rules) even with their very Lives, though they did not ſee nor underſtand the things that are now ſeen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by many; yet (bleſſed be the Lord) they were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93507:18"/>
by his Power and Spirit ſo furniſhed, and ſuſtained, and ſo filled with Love to God and his Cauſe, and with Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the falſe Church, and her Antichriſtian Impoſitions and Idolatries; that they loved not their Lives unto death, but laid down their Lives with Chearfulneſs, as a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them; and ſo, through Faith have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Good Report amongſt us, who are now following the Lamb in the ſame Foot-ſteps of the Flock.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, my Beloved Friends, Seeing that now, in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, God hath rais'd us up by his Power, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Purpoſe, and Determination, and Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to be faithful Witneſſes for his Name and Truth, and to the Power of his Appearance in our Hearts, and to bear Teſtimony againſt the aforeſaid Superſtitions, and and Idolatrous Impoſitions, which are practis'd at this day amongſt them that know not the only true and living God, nor Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent a Light into the World: I ſay, my Friends, Theſe things are ſufficient to engage our Hearts unto the Lord, follow him unto the end, through all Trials and Exerciſes, of what nature or kind ſoever, that for the future may come upon us, for our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies ſake: For, my Friends, We know right well, that God hath not been wanting unto us in any Tryal or State whatſoever (if we have not been wanting in or Obedience unto him) but hath been alwayes preſent with us, and hath oft caus'd his Love to abound unto us, and in us, being ſhed abroad in our hearts by his good Spirit; ſo that for joy of Heart we could even ſing Praiſes to the Name of the Lord in the midſt of our Sufferings and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; ſo that we have no Cauſe to be diſcourag'd at the Sufferings which attend us, nor at the Threats and Frowns of Wicked Men, who hate and perſecute us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a juſt Cauſe; but we have rather great Cauſe of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93507:19"/>
to perſevere and go on, bearing forth our Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the Lord through all Sufferings, if it be Death it ſelf, knowing the Reward thereof to be ſo exceeding great; and having this Confidence in our ſelves, <hi>That none of theſe things ſhall be able to move us, nor to ſeperate us from the Love of God which we have in Christ Jeſus:</hi> Nay, but rather ſhall confirm us; for as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>It is an evident Token to us of Salvation, but to our Adverſaries of Perdition, and that of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo, my Beloved Friends, You who are already Exil'd, and ſent into forreign Parts of the World, for your Teſtimony's ſake; I doubt not but you experimentally know, in an eſpecial manner, the Largeneſs of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God's Love unto his People in a <hi>Suffering Condition,</hi> you having been in meaſure exercis'd therein, beyond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; though I doubt not (but have the Teſtimony of God's Holy Spirit) that many are as freely given up in the ſame Faith, for the ſame Teſtimony, to partake with you outwardly of the ſame <hi>Sufferings,</hi> as they do inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſympathize with you therein, if the Lord ſee it meet for the Honour of his Name, ſo to ſuffer them to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; Yet nevertheleſs, All who have been, and are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God in their Places, have, and do enjoy ſo much of the Peace and Preſence of God, as is fully ſatisfactory unto them; ſo that in the Unity of the Spirit of Life, which from God we have receiv'd, and by which we are ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the World, and its Wayes and Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by which we are rais'd up to be faithful and true Witneſſes for God, and againſt the Traditions of men, by which they have made void God's Commandments; I ſay, in this Spirit we do ſympathize and partake with you, both in Suffering and in Rejoycing, and have a real Sence upon our hearts and ſpirits of your Eſtate; and we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93507:19"/>
of you, but do heartily pray, That Grace, Health, Mercy, and Peace, together with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt our Lord, may be continually multiplied and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed amongſt you, that the Aboundings thereof you may know unto your great Conſolation; that ſo, being thereby watered and refreſhed, you may grow in the Grace of God, and in the Knowledge of our Lord Jeſus, and may feel his Life to encreaſe in you, and ſo to ſtrengthen you, that you thereby may be able to teach others alſo, and to inſtruct them in the Way of Life and Salvation, that ſo your Sufferings and Exilement may make for the Furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Goſpel of God, and for the ſpreading of his Bleſſed Glorious Truth through the Nations, and for the gathering into it them who are yet afar off from God, and Strangers unto him; that ſo the Witneſs of God in all Conſciences being anſwer'd by you, both in Life, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and Doctrine you may be a good ſavour unto God, both in them that believe, and alſo in them that periſh, that the Juſtification of Life in the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt you may all feel and witneſs, and that will be your alone Satisfaction in all Conditions, and therein my Love doth dearly ſalute you all.</p>
                  <p>And in this, my Dear Friends, pray one for another, and walk together in Love, and be of one Mind and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in all things that appertain to the Worſhip of God, and to your Teſtimony for Him, and againſt the World, and its Wayes and Worſhips; and live in Peace one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and build up one another in your moſt precious Faith; and watch over one another in the Spirit of Love and Meekneſs; and let there be no Straightneſs nor Strangeneſs one towards another; but be Open-hearted and Tender one to another: And if any thing appear amongſt any of you, which tends to the Hurt of any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93507:20"/>
or to the Truth in general, in the Spirit of Meekneſs let it be ſpoken to them, and in the ſame Spirit let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; and that will keep down all that may ariſe to make any Diſſention, to cauſe any ſtraitneſs or ſtrangeneſs amongſt you, and ſo you will be kept in the unity of the Truth, which will be a good ſavour amongſt all people; and in that the Lord will take Delight to dwell amongſt you, and to do you good; and in that God Almighty be with you, and bleſs you, and water you with the Dew of Heaven, and cauſe the Showers of his Love to deſcend upon you, that you may be refreſhed and kept alive in the Truth, therein to live according to God in the Spirit, and not according to men in the Fleſh, but in that by which you are judged according to men, and by which you are crucified unto the World; and therein your Joy, Peace, and Comfott will be Everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>And ſo dear Friends, Let nothing enter that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of your Peace and Comfort, leſt you loſe the Reward of your Sufferings; but keep in Lowlineſs, and Watchfulneſs, and in true Humility of mind and ſpirit; for therein is Safety: And its the Humble that God teacheth and ſupporteth: And without his aſſiſting Spirit of Grace we can do nothing that will add to our Comfort or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; and therefore, whatever our ſtate be, we have daily need of an Aſſiſtance from him, and of the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſtrength by him, by whom alone we are able to do all things, and in him nothing is too hard for us; for its through him (that we are more then Conquerors, and by Faith in him) we ſtand, and that gives Victory over the World: And in that, my Dear Friends, all live and walk, and thereby you will have free acceſs to God, and will meet with us at the Throne of Grace, and Ocean of Life; and there the Miniſter of the Sanctuary is ſeen alwayes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93507:20"/>
near at hand, adminiſtring unto every one according to their neceſſity, who will give Ability and Strength ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to endure all things, and to anſwer his Requirings in all things; and will alſo keep down (and under) all which would ariſe to exalt the mind above meaſure in the time of enjoyment of the Reward that is receiv'd through Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and hereby you will be preſerv'd out of all the Snares of the Enemy: And in this my Love is dear to you all, and to the whole Flock of God in all Parts of the World; and to this Spirit of Grace I do commit you all, and reſign you up to be govern'd and protected thereby; for, by it I was at this time moved to write theſe Lines to you, in which I doubt not but it will be received, by all whoſe hearts are ſincere towards God: And in that God Almighty be with your ſpirits, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>MY Dearly Beloved Friends, I ofttimes remember you, &amp; make mention of you in my Prayers to the Lord, ſince I outwardly ſaw your Faces, and my Love in the Lord is unfeigned to you, in which I have, for your Good travel'd amongſt you, and in which at this time I dearly ſalute you, as thoſe whom God Almighty hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto and viſited, that you might have Acquaintance with him, and that you might be made Partakers of his Endleſs Love in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and therewith might love one another, as he hath loved you, who hath forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you your Treſpaſſes, that you might take Example thereby to Forgive one another; that ſo you may have the Mind of his Spirit of Love, and be like him in this preſent evil World, and that you might bear his Image amongſt the Children of Men, and ſtand as Witneſſes for him, and appear on his behalf in that Life, through which you will anſwer the Witneſs of God in the Hearts of all People; that ſo you bring Honour, and Glory, and Praiſe to the Name of the Lord, who hath viſited you; <hi>To whom all Glory belongs forever,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>My Beloved Friends, Prize the Mercies of the Lord, with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93507:21"/>
which he hath viſited you; and walk worthy of his Love, which hath been additionally manifeſted through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tender Viſitations which he hath ſent unto you by his <hi>Servants,</hi> whom he hath moved from time to time to come amongſt you with the Meſſage of Life, as Diſpencers of his Word of Reconciliation, for your Conſolation and Comfort: And every one in your own particulars, feel the Meaſure of the Meek Spirit of the Lamb, that your minds may be daily exercis'd thereby, in the Croſs to all that is contrary to the Nature thereof, that ſo your Hearts and Souls may be ſeaſon'd therewith, and the contrary kept down and bow'd under it: And as all are exerciſed with this Spirit of the Lamb, you will more and more grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its nature, through the refreſhing Vertue which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and thereby you will daily receive; and this is alone that which preſents all a Good Savour unto God; and in this (you know) we have labour'd among'ſt you; and therein you will feel my Love and Life, which is in that which is not of this World; and therein the Fellowſhip of the Children of Light ſtands, which is a Myſtery to the <hi>World;</hi> and in that, <hi>Love, Unity, Peace, Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs</hi> will encreaſe amongſt you, which are excellent <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> and amiable to behold; and that which is Paſſionate, or Haſty and Unſavoury ſhall not have a place amongſt you; but you will all be Examples of good one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And alſo, Your <hi>Life,</hi> and Holy Chaſte <hi>Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> will preach unto the <hi>World,</hi> by which they that are without ſhall be <hi>convinc'd,</hi> and made to confeſs, <hi>That God is in you;</hi> and in this you will be a <hi>Good Savour</hi> unto God; and he will take Delight to manifeſt his Preſence and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings amongſt you, and to multiply his Mercies unto you; and will water you daily with the Dew of Heaven, through which you will be kept in the Freſhneſs of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93507:22"/>
Life of the Bleſſed Unchangeable Truth; for the Lord waits to be Gratious unto all them that wait upon him for the Teachings of his Spirit of Grace, and are taught there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and ſuch he enricheth with the Riches of his Grace, through which they live unto him; and in that all are a ſtrength one unto another, and a Refreſhment and Comfort to each other: And ſo, my dear Friends, In that God Almighty keep you, and be with you, and water you dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Dew of Heaven, that you may grow thereby; and dwell all in Watchfulneſs, in the Light, and keep in the weighty Truth, the true Foundation, that the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all may be kept clear and open, that none may be beguil'd of their Peace nor Crown of Life: And all watch over one another in Love; and bear ye one anothers Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and ſo fulfil the Law of God, and in that you are a ſtrength one to another; and ſo in this feel the Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Love, which is to you beyond declaring. And to the Keeping and Protection of the Arm of the Lord I do commit you, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>To all People in JAMAICA Unto whom the MESSAGE OF Eternal Life is ſent; and amongſt whom the Goſpel is now preached.</head>
                  <p>FRIENDS, Now the Everlaſting Goſpel of Peace and Glad-tidings is preached amongſt you, and the Word of Reconciliation reacheth forth towards you, every one with Meekneſs receive it; for it is able to ſave your Souls, and to build you up, and give you an Inheritance amongſt the ſanctified Ones: For now is the Meſſage of the Lord to be declar'd unto you, and amongſt you, by True and Faithful Meſſengers, whom he hath ſent forth in his Name, and endew'd with Power for that Service; and hath made them willing, for your ſakes, to give up their Lives, that the Way of Life
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93507:23"/>
might be made known unto you, and you might come to walk therein: And their Meſſage you are all to receive, as you prize the Salvation of your Souls; for they are Meſſengers of the New Covenant, into which the Lord (in this Day of his Glorious Appearance) is gathering his People, that they might be all taught of him, and come to the Knowledge of him, from the Leaſt to the Greateſt.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, This Covenant, of which I ſpeak, which they are Meſſengers of, is Light; and this Light lighteth every man that cometh into the World, which, if you give heed unto, in your own Conſciences, you will find it reproving for the Deeds of Darkneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſin in the Fleſh; and will lead all, who are guided by it, out of ſin; and will lead in the Way of Righteouſneſs, and in the Path of Peace, and Way of True Holineſs, which is a Way that the World knows not, who live in Iniquity. Wherefore now all People, The Day of your Viſitation being upon you, and the Lord ſtriving with you by his Good Spirit in your Hearts, and being alſo calling unto you by the Mouthes of his Meſſengers, to Returns; Now every one encline your Ears, and hear what the Spirit ſaith in your inward Parts; and prize the Day of the Viſitation of the Lord's Love, who, after the long time that you have paſſed away in Rebellion and Diſobedience againſt his Good Spirit, ſhould now be pleaſed to accept of you, and to paſs by your Tranſgreſſions paſt, and the Sins of your Youth; therefore I ſay, Let the Rich Love of the Lord, which is now manifeſted, conſtrain you to Fear before him, and to learn Obedience unto his Faithful Witneſs, which he hath placed in your Hearts: For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93507:23"/>
Friends, it concerns your Eternal Peace; and now is the Day wherein you may come to the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, before they be hid from your Eyes: For, truly Friends, If you be not attentive unto that which will give unto you the knowledge of thoſe things, the time will come, that they will be hid from your Eyes; and then ſhall you cry out, ſaying, <hi>How have we hated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and deſpiſed the Day of Healing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo, Now the Day is, wherein you may come to know and witneſs your Reconciliation made with the Lord by his Word of Power, which is nigh you, even in your Hearts and in your Mouthes; which Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles to God all who hear and obey it; and it will alſo purge you from all Iniquity, if you ſubmit to the Working and Operation of it.</p>
                  <p>And this I teſtifie, That no other Way can you come to know a being ſanctified and reconcil'd to the Lord, but by the Word of his Power, and through your Obedience thereunto: And this Teſtimony I ſend amongſt you, to the end that you might believe in the Light of the Son of God, wherewith you are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened: And this Teſtimony will be further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you by the Mouthes of theſe whom the Lord hath now ſent amongſt you; and their Teſtimony is true, of which I am a Witneſs; for we have been all Baptized by one Spirit into one Body, even the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body of him who is the Head: And ſo we are all Eye-Witneſſes of his Majeſty, and of his Glory; and can give in our Teſtimony together, That by the Mouthes of ſeveral Witneſſes (even ſo many as the Lord ſhall call) the TRUTH may be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you; that ſo you may no longer follow them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93507:24"/>
who cry, <hi>Lo here,</hi> or <hi>Lo there;</hi> For, behold the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is within you, and comes not with Obſervations; and all that enter into it muſt become as little Children; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God, which is now come with Power, and is nigh unto you: And Bleſſed and Happy are all they that come to know an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance adminiſtred into it; for they are Heirs of that Inheritance which ſhall never fade away.</p>

                  <p>DEAR FRIENDS, My Love, which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and fervent in the Lord's Truth (which is as precious as ever in this Day of Tryal) is freely and fervently extended to you: For, oft are you in my Remembrance, in much tenderneſs; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do I Reſpect you as ſuch whom the Lord hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to bear his Name, and which he hath made choice of to be a Peculiar People to himſelf, and to be Witneſſes for him in the mid'ſt of a Crooked and Perverſe Generation.</p>
                  <p>And let your Holy Life and Chaſte Converſation be ſuch, as may preach Righteouſneſs unto all; that if they ſpeak Evil of you, as of Evil-Doers, you may have cauſe to Rejoyce, having the Peace of God in your Hearts.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, I am not unmindful of you, neither
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93507:25"/>
are you forgotten by me: For, oft I am even amongſt you in the Spirit of Love and Life, in which my Deſires and Prayers to God are, and oft have been for you, that you may grow, and encreaſe, and proſper, and flouriſh in the precious living glorious Truth of God, of which you are made Partakers, and into which you are gather'd, through the working of his Divine Power, that ſo the Heavenly Image may be borne by you all; that by your Good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs many may be made to confeſs unto the Truth, and be convinced of it; and that to the Brightneſs of your riſing in it, many may be gather'd; that ſo the Borders of the Sanctuary of the Moſt High may be enlarg'd unto the ends of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>For Friends, You know full well, that in the Power of God, yea, the Power of an Endleſs Life, We, (whom the Lord ſent unto you) labour'd amongſt you for the Exaltation of his Kingdom, and for the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſpreading of his Everlaſting Truth; and for the ſake of this, our Lives nor Liberties were not dear unto us; wherefore be ye every one like-minded with us in the ſame thing: And in your places where the Lord hath ſet you, therein adorn the Truth, ſo will you be a good ſavour unto God, and he will take Pleaſure and Delight in you, and will do you good by multiplying his Mercies and Bleſſings in your Hearts; and ſo you will witneſs a growth and encreaſe in the Encreaſes of God.</p>
                  <p>And ſo all Friends, Wait upon the Lord in the Gift of his Spirit, that you may feel him to adminiſter unto you of his Heavenly Riches and Conſolation, that no one may have cauſe to complain of Poverty or Wearineſs; but every one know him in you, in whom the Fulneſs dwells, that you may by him be upheld in all times of Tryal, and

be adminiſtred unto in all times of want, that ſo you may be carried on with Chearfulneſs to run the Way of his Commandments. And God Almighty keep you by his own Power, that therein you may be firmly joyn'd and united together, a Family of Love, and a ſtrong Body, and a ſpiritual Houſe fitly framed and compacted, that there may be no Rent nor Diviſion; but that you may be one in him, who is the Head: and in this I can promiſe you the Bleſſings of God, and that by his Spirit. And ſo, bear one with another in Love; and let the Strong help the Weak, and by ſo doing you will preſerve Peace. <hi>And the Bleſſing of the Lord be with you, and rest upon you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>DEAR and Everlaſtingly Beloved Friends, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſters, whom my Heavenly Father hath viſited with the Day-ſpring from on High, which he hath cauſed to dawn unto you; and by his Out-ſtretched Arm of Power, hath gather'd you out of the <hi>Egyptian Darkneſs</hi> into the marvellous Light of the Son of his Love, that therein you may come to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance amongſt them that are ſanctified, and become Heirs of Eternal and Everlaſting Salvation in and through Chriſt Jeſus, the Firſt-born from the Dead, who is now brought forth into the World, and reveal'd in us, whom all the Angels muſt worſhip.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, my dear Friends, Seeing the Lord hath thus viſited you with his Love, and thus reached unto you, ſee that you walk worthy of his Love: And every one in your holy Callings, wherewith you are called of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in abide with him; and feel the Gift of his good Spirit of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93507:26"/>
Grace, which from him you have receiv'd, at all times to exerciſe your minds; that ſo, out of all the Snares and Temptations of the Wicked One you may thereby be led, kept, and preſerved, that the Enemy may not prevail to hurt you, or to deprive you of your precious Treaſure, or to make a Spoile of you, or in the leaſt to diminiſh that Precious Life which God hath raiſed and manifeſted in you, and given you a feeling of: But all, and every one, wait that you may grow therein, and become daily more and more a good ſavour unto God, that you may know him to take delight in you, and to dwell amongſt you, and in the midſt of you, and to adminiſter unto you according to your Neceſſities, that there may be no want unto you in the Day of Tryal; but that you may be throughly furniſhed unto every good Word and Work; that in all Tryals and Temptations whatſoever, that may come upon you, you may feel your Strength, Hope and Confidence to remain, that ſo you may be ſupported and carried through with Chearfulneſs unto the End; for its ſuch only that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>And above all things, my Friends and Brethren, have perfect Charity amongſt your ſelves; and let the Love of God dwell in your Hearts, and rule there, and in that watch over one another; and in the Spirit of Love and Meekneſs exhort and beſeech one another, as the Lord moves; and let no one go beyond the Word of the Lord, nor yet without it; for that will burden the Seed in others; but watch in the Light for the Movings of the Life it ſelf; and as that is felt to ſtir or move in you, or any of you, wait to know the Mind and Intent of the Spirit's Motion, whether it be for your ſelves to treaſure up, or whether it be to give forth unto others; and this Diſcerning and Underſtanding you will all come to know
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93507:27"/>
and receive as you wait in Stilneſs, out of the Reaſoning Part; for, if the Reaſoning Part enter, that will darken the Underſtanding, and then you will not know what to choſe, and what to refuſe, nor what to do, or what to leave undone: Therefore dwell in the Simplicity, and ſingle Subjection unto God's Holy Spirit of Life, the Meek Lamb's Spirit; and there is the Gate of true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Door of Underſtanding; and in that you will edifie one another in Love, and the Bond of Peace will be known amongſt you: And for this End have we travell'd and labour'd amongſt you, whom the Lord ſent forth in his own Name and Power, for the turning of you from the darkneſs of Ignorance unto the Light and Knowledge of God's Everlaſting Power, and for the building of you up in your moſt pretious holy Faith, that therein, and thereby you might come to have victory over all that's contrary. And to this day I am oft travelling in Spirit amongſt you; and in my Prayers to God, I daily make mention of you; and my ſpirit breathes unto God, and is pour'd forth unto him for your preſervation, growth, and proſperity in the pretious living <hi>Truth,</hi> and that you may be crown'd with <hi>Victory, Life,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over all which would <hi>hinder you from running this good Race,</hi> that is ſet before you; that ſo none amongſt you, who have <hi>taſted of the Love of God,</hi> and have <hi>known the Way of Life,</hi> may fall ſhort of the <hi>Mark,</hi> or of the <hi>Inheritance incorruptible,</hi> which fades not away. <hi>So the Lord God Almighty be with you, and keep you, and place his Fear in your Hearts yet more and more, that you may no more depart from him, or from the feeling of his Life and Preſence; but that you may always live in him, who is God bleſſed forever; and may be found of him in everlaſting Peace,</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>MY Dearly Beloved Friends, with whom, and amongſt whom I have travell'd in times paſt, for the Redemption of the <hi>Suffering Seed,</hi> which lay groaning in Bondage, and was held in Captivity under the Chains of Death and Darkneſs in you; and for the bringing forth of that Birth which is Heir of all things, and muſt Rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron, and unto whom we (who have been Labourers amongſt you) have reached with the Word of Immortal Life, and with the Power of the Almighty, to the raiſing of Life, and bringing Immortality to Light in you, by which you were then quicken'd unto Life, who were ſometimes dead in Sin and Treſpaſſes: And you know right well, that by this Word of God, and Power of an Endleſs Life you were more and more enlighten'd, as you came into Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto; and your Underſtandings were open'd, by which you came to ſee how you had been in times paſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93507:28"/>
captivated with Sin and Iniquity, and had been led away with the Error of the Wicked, into Envy, Strife, and Maliciouſneſs; and indeed, into every Evil Work; and then true Judgment and Condemnation took hold on that part in you, by which you had been led into thoſe things; and the Way of Truth, Peace, Love, Sanctification, and Salvation, open'd unto you, by the Light and Spirit of the Lord, by which your Underſtandings were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And the Inviſible Eye was open'd in you, by which you came to ſee your Teacher; and as you enclin'd your Ear unto this Teacher, and walked in this Light of God's Salvation; O then, how was the Appearance of Evil eſchewed by you? And how contrary to your Deſires it was to ſee or hear of Strife, and Debate, and Contention amongſt Brethren? And how Love, Peace, and Good-will did then abound one towards another, and towards all men, deſiring that all might come to know and be made Partakers with you of the ſame plentious Redemption? And how gloriouſly and plentifully the Lord did then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amongſt you? And how freely he did then ſhed abroad his Love in your Hearts, and iſſue forth of the Vertue of his Life unto you, by which your Hearts were enlarged, and your ſouls refreſhed and comforted; ſo that you did run well (without Wearineſs or Fainting) Who hath hindred you, or any of you, that you ſhould not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in this Race, in which Peace, Love, and Good-will did abound one unto another? And what is the cauſe of the Strife, and Diviſions, and Contentions, that of late hath been amongſt you? Hath not the Evil One ſtepped in, and drawn you into Reaſonings and Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about Differences which hath been occaſion'd by Diſſenting-ſpirits, and thereby vail'd the Underſtandings of ſome of you, and ſo brought Night upon them; and

in the Night ſeaſon ſown the ſeed of Sedition amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Well, My Heart is griev'd within me for your ſakes; and I am oft-times afflicted in ſpirit becauſe of theſe things which have happen'd amongſt you: for indeed, ſome there be, that have made the Hearts of others ſad, whom God never made ſad, becauſe of their unſoundneſs, and unſtedfaſtneſs in the Truth, which in much ſimplicity, fear, and reverence was made known unto you by us, who labour'd amongſt you in the Word and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And truly Friends, I cannot but Lament the loſt eſtate of ſome amongſt you, which I am fully ſenſible is great and ſad: Oh that ever it ſhould be ſaid of ſuch a People (for whom the Lord had done ſuch great things, and unto whom he had ſo plentifully manifeſted himſelf and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that they ſhould not retain their firſt Love, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and Fervency, and Zeal to the Lord, and one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another! Its indeed ſad to conſider: For have not I ſeen the <hi>Lilly</hi> bloſſom amongſt you, and the <hi>Vine</hi> flouriſh, and the tender <hi>Grapes</hi> appear? yes verily. And this I further teſtifie, <hi>That while you kept your first Simplicity, and your first Faith and Love, you were Beautiful, and Comely, and Lovely in the Eyes of the Lord; and he took great Delight in you; and exercis'd Judgment, Mercy, and Loving-kindneſs amongst you; in which many did greatly Rejoyce; and your Faith was every where ſpoken of amongst the Churches of Christ; and many did greatly Rejoyce becauſe of you; for you were Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and lovely in the Hearts of the People of God every where; and you were even a Crown of Rejoycing unto us, who had labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst you, and travell'd for your ſakes.</hi> But alas! A contrary ſpirit hath ſince entred amongſt ſome of you, with which we have not Unity nor Fellowſhip; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of which hath brought <hi>Sadneſs</hi> upon the Hearts of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93507:29"/>
many: But thoſe who have given place to the Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous-One, muſt bear their own Burden; for their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Condemnation ſlumbreth not, but will ſwiftly come upon them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my dear Ftiends all, Be you retir'd in your minds unto the Light, by which you were firſt convinced of the Truth, and which gave you then to ſee the Error of your Wayes, and which led you into Love, Peace, and Good-will one towards another, and towards all men; and to eſchew the appearance of Evil: And as you all (in this Light) come ſingly to wait upon the Lord in your firſt Love, Simplicity, and Integrity, you will plainly and clearly ſee what it is that hath entred (and how it entred) that hath been the cauſe of all thoſe Tumults, and Contentions, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which of late hath (happen'd and) been amongſt you; and as its ſeen with the Light, and diſcover'd thereby unto you, or any of you, let it by the Life be judged from amongſt you; and therein wait that you may be purged from all Filthineſs, both of Fleſh and Spirit: And be tenderly affectionated one towards another in the Truth; not with a feigned Love, or a feigned Affection; for that God hates: But let Love be without Diſſimulation, abhorring that which is <hi>Evil</hi> in all, and cleaving to that which is <hi>Good:</hi> And be Open-Hearted one towards another (not Strange and Staightned) and Simply and Honeſtly confeſs your Faults to each other, and pray for one another, and the Lord will have Mercy upon the Tranſgreſſors, and will heal their Backſlidings and blot out their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and will again love them freely; and ſo you will re-gain the Favour, Love, and Good-will of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; and we ſhall again be <hi>comforted in you,</hi> after
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93507:29"/>
theſe our <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Grief of Heart,</hi> becauſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Spoilings that have been amongſt <hi>you;</hi> for, our Joy is in your Proſperity and Well-being; and our Rejoying is in <hi>your</hi> Comfort, and Refreſhment, and Preſervation, and Safety.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, my Friends, Keep your Eye alwayes upon that Mark which firſt you preſſed after, when you receiv'd the Truth, and obey'd the Goſpel; and in that ſtraight and narrow Way of Holineſs, which was then made known unto you, every one ſtill preſs towards this Mark; and have perfect Charity amongſt your ſelves, as in the time of your firſt Simplicity: And then you will feel the Lords wonted <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> ſhed abroad in <hi>your</hi> Hearts; and he will water <hi>you</hi> with the Dew of Heaven, and will bleſs <hi>you</hi> with all Spiritual Bleſſings from above; and he will then own <hi>you</hi> for his own, and will dwell in the mid'ſt of you, and amongſt you; for which the earneſt Deſire of my Soul is unto the Lord; and in my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers I do oft make mention of you unto my God and your God, that his Arm of Power and Salvation may alwayes be with you; and that you may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by kept Pure, and Unrebukeable, and Spotleſs unto Himſelf in his ſight, from this time forth and forever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Friends, It was the fervent and ſincere Deſire of my Heart to have ſeen you this Year; having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Perſwaſion and Aſſurance in me, That (if the Lord had ſo order'd it) it would have been for your <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Benefit;</hi> and that I ſhould have been Refreſhed with you and amongſt you, as in times paſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:93507:30"/>And in order to it I wholy fixed and applyed my Heart to the Lord (for ſome certain dayes) to ſearch his Counſel in the thing, until he fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied me, that it muſt not then be; in whoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Will I reſt, and am content: yet am not wholy without hopes, but that in Due Seaſon it may yet be. And in the mean time I leave you, and commend you to God, who is able to keep you, and do more aboundantly for you then you can ask or think; to whom be Glory forever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>MY Dear Friends, Brethren, and Siſters, who are called and ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus; and with whom, and amongſt whom I have travell'd both in Body and Spirit, for the Reſurrection of that Birth which is Immortal; through which you might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Heirs of Eternal Salvation, and of the Kingdom Everlaſting, which is not of this World.</p>
                  <p>My ſoul and bowels even daily earn towards you; and you are even daily preſented before me, and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my View and Remembrance by the Spirit of the Lord; by which I am oft conſtrain'd to preſent my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Prayers to the God of my Life for you, and on your behalfs; beſeeching and deſiring him, that he will keep and preſerve you in the Unſpotted Life of the Lamb; and that Grace, Mercy, and Peace, together
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93507:31"/>
with Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, may be multipy'd and encreas'd amongſt you.</p>
                  <p>My beloved Friends, Keep your ſtation in the Holy Place, every one who know it; and in your Holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wherewith you are call'd of God, therein abide and walk with him; that therein you may all adorn the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, You certainly know, That the Living, Bleſſed, and Everlaſting Truth it ſelf (which ſanctifies throughly, both in <hi>Soul, Body,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> and which ſets free from the <hi>Bondage of Corruption</hi> all who continue in it) hath been freely made manifeſt amongſt you: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I charge you all, as you will anſwer the Lord, Every one ſee that you live and walk in the Purity thereof.</p>
                  <p>And you likewiſe know the Way of Life, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of Holineſs (in which no unclean thing can paſs) ſee therefore that you continue therein; that ſo, whenſoever your Lord comes, you may be found of him in Peace, and cover'd with his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>For you have all need of Circumſpection, and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and Diligence; becauſe the Adverſary of your Soul's Peace is very ſubtil, and lodgeth very near to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one; and waits to devour, and lurkes to deſtroy; and will loſe no Opportunity, if poſſible he may beguile any of you, as he did <hi>Eve</hi> in the beginning.—But as you all watch in the Light of God's Salvation, which he hath cauſed to ſhine unto you, the Adverſary will thereby be diſcover'd unto you in all his Twindings and Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
                  <p>And my Friends, This Light, in which you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, is the true Touch-ſtone, by which all ſpirits may be tryed, and all Motions (in whom ſoever they ariſe)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93507:31"/>
may hereby be known, whether they be of God, and tend to that which is conſiſtant with the <hi>Honour</hi> of Truth, and your own Peace; or whether they ſavour of the Fleſh, and tend to the ſatisfying of the Luſts thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For, the Luſts of the Fleſh, and of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, are not of the Father, but of the World, which paſſeth away:</hi> And where (or in whomſoever) theſe, or either of theſe are found, and diſcover'd by the Light, which makes all things manifeſt; they are therewith to be condemned, and by you to be denied; that ſo you may be every one kept out of the Snare of the Devourer, and out of the Net of the mighty Hunter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For, If you live after the Fleſh, you ſhall dye;</hi> for the Luſts thereof, when they are conceiv'd, bring forth ſin; and the Wages of ſin is death: But every one, who through the ſpirit mortifies the Deeds of the fleſh, ſuch ſhall live to God in the Newneſs of Life; and ſuch will adorn the Goſpel of God.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, my dear Friends, You are called to Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>but not to ſerve your ſelves;</hi> therefore uſe not your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as an Occaſion to the Fleſh, <hi>leſt thereby you be enſnared;</hi> neither uſe it as an Occaſion of ſtumbling <hi>unto others:</hi> but every one, in the Fear of the Lord, ſtand faſt in that <hi>glorious Liberty,</hi> wherewith Chriſt hath made <hi>you</hi> free. And beware of being again entangled with the heavy Yoak of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and of being brought into Captivity with that which in meaſure you had <hi>Victory over</hi>—For, <hi>you</hi> (that have paſſed from Death to Life) know right well (and I need not tell <hi>you</hi>) through what Difficulties, Hardſhips, and Exerciſes <hi>you</hi> obtain'd that precious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the Truth, which <hi>you</hi> are brought unto: And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93507:32"/>
                     <hi>you</hi> alſo know what it coſt <hi>you</hi> to purchaſe the Poſſeſſion of that meaſure of Life and Truth, which is manifeſted amongſt <hi>you;</hi> therefore let none ſell his Birth-right <hi>for a Meſs of Pottage;</hi> neither let any periſhing Object become a ſnare, or divert <hi>you</hi> from <hi>your</hi> Simplicity and Sincerity in the Truth.</p>
                  <p>But every one walk worthy of the matchleſs Love of God, which hath extended its ſelf unto <hi>you,</hi> that ſo the daily Multiplyings and Abounding thereof <hi>you</hi> may know and witneſs in <hi>your</hi> hearts; that through it <hi>you</hi> may Grow, and Increaſe, and be Enriched; and that God Almighty may take delight to dwell amongſt <hi>you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And my Friends, The ſavoury holy Order that the Truth led into in the beginning, and in which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were exercis'd, <hi>you</hi> are not ignorant of; and I hope not unmindful of it neither: And <hi>you</hi> likewiſe know what Fervency, and Fear, and Zeal towards God the Truth wrought in <hi>your</hi> Hearts, when <hi>you</hi> firſt receiv'd the Teſtimony thereof; And what a Godly Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was put on by many? and there was not another thing accounted of by many of <hi>you,</hi> in compariſon of his Bleſſed Truth.</p>
                  <p>And whatſoever things were honeſt and <hi>of Good Report,</hi> and by which the Truth might have been <hi>adorn'd;</hi> how readily would <hi>you</hi> have been made <hi>conformable</hi> thereunto, though <hi>you</hi> had deny'd <hi>your ſelves</hi> therein? And then how did the Bleſſings of God, with Peace and Unity one with another, abound amongſt <hi>you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, I hope (and doubt not but that) <hi>you</hi> are ſtill like-minded in the ſame thing many of <hi>you;</hi> and that <hi>you</hi> have the ſame <hi>Conſolation</hi> abounding amongſt <hi>you:</hi> But if
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93507:32"/>
any be otherwiſe-minded, I would have ſuch know, that the Truth is of the ſame <hi>worth,</hi> as ever it was; and of as great <hi>price,</hi> with all who really walk therein, as ever it was eſteem'd by ſuch; and this God ſhall reveal unto them in his Day.</p>
                  <p>And if any retain not their firſt Love, Zeal, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency; but walk diſorderly, and not according to the Truth of the Goſpel, which was preached unto you by us in the beginning; I ſay, if we, or any other ſhall walk amongſt <hi>you</hi> not according to that Holy Order of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by which it may be adorn'd, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe (the Admonition of the Spirit of Meekneſs) to be humbled for his diſorderly walking; have no Fellowſhip with ſuch a one; but let him be accounted as a <hi>Heathen</hi> and a <hi>Publican</hi> unto <hi>you,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> may deal with him for his Iniquity according to his Deſerts: Yet nevertheleſs, againſt an Elder receive not an Accuſation, except it be by the Mouthes of <hi>two or three</hi> Witneſſes; that nothing be done, but that which may tend to the Edification of all, and not to the Deſtruction of any.</p>
                  <p>And farther, my Friends, If any amongſt <hi>you</hi> ſhall walk, not as becomes the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt, nor according to that <hi>ſavoury holy Order,</hi> that the Truth hath led, and doth lead into; but by any <hi>unſavoury Actions or Motions whatſoever,</hi> ſhall vary from the Simplicity and Purity of the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet let not that become a <hi>Stumbling-Block unto any,</hi> nor cauſe any to fall from the Faith which <hi>you</hi> have receiv'd, and through which <hi>you</hi> have <hi>obtain'd Remiſſion</hi> of Sins, and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Life:</hi> For the Unfaithfulneſs or diſorderly walking of ſome will not be a ſufficient Excuſe for others in the Day of the Lord, when they are called to an account; but every one, who have taſted of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God, and have receiv'd the Gift of his Spirit, be faithful
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93507:33"/>
thereunto, that <hi>you</hi> may improve <hi>your</hi> Tallent, which is committed to <hi>you:</hi> For every one muſt give an account for himſelf unto God; and none can excuſe <hi>you</hi> before him: therefore I ſay, Look not at the Haltings of others (though it ſhould be ſuch, who have ſeem'd to be as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) nor think to make that a Plea, or an Excuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from the Purity of the Holy Way of the Lord; for, although that may ſerve for an Argument amongſt men; yet that will not ſerve when God ſhall come to plead with ſuch, before whom all Hearts are open, and all things naked and bare; and he will give to every one a juſt Reward, according to their Deeds.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, I ſay, Let every one have an Eye unto the Lord in all things, and mind their own ſtate, and how it ſtands betwixt them and the Lord; and that will keep them from looking-out, and conſulting about the ſtate of others, who may vary from the Purity of the <hi>Truth;</hi> for hereby the <hi>occaſion</hi> of ſtumbling comes unto many—But rather let the halting of ſuch be as Dreadful Examples unto <hi>you,</hi> to take Warning by; that ſo <hi>you</hi> may be kept in Fear and Faithfulneſs, in Watchfulneſs and Diligence, leſt <hi>you</hi> fall into the ſame Temptation and Snare of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>For, my Friends, Whither can any go to find Life, Immortal Conſolation, and Satisfaction to their Souls, if they ſhould forſake the precious Truth, of which we have born teſtimony (in the Life and Demonſtration of God's Spirit) amongſt you, and through which many of <hi>you</hi> have found Reſt to <hi>your</hi> Souls, after many long and ſore <hi>Travels?</hi> Truly there is not another thing that can add unto your everlaſting Conſolation, if once any of <hi>you</hi> ſhould vary, or ſlip aſide from that: And this I hope (and doubt not but) that many, or moſt of <hi>you</hi> are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93507:33"/>
and ſatisfied in—Therefore continue therein, and therein be unanimous in <hi>your</hi> Service and Obedience unto the Lord; that by him, his Good Spirit, and Word of Grace, <hi>you</hi> may be eſtabliſhed forever.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning <hi>the ſtate</hi> of Marriages, You know the comely Order of the Church in the primitive Times, before the Apoſtacy began; and how the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>If any be called, being Married, let him nor ſeek to be looſed</hi> (nay, though he or ſhe had an Unbelieving Wife or Husband) <hi>but let the Husband render due Benevolence to the Wife, and likewiſe, the Wife to the Husband.</hi> And further, By Commiſſion from God he ſaid, <hi>Let not the Wife depart from her Husband.</hi>—And ſo ſay I unto <hi>you,</hi> in the Name and Fear of the Lord, Let none give place in the leaſt to that ſpirit that would beget Inclinations in the Wife or Husband to depart one from another; but let every man have his own Wife, and every woman her own Husband: For, whatſoever Pretence or Covering that ſpirit (that would ſeparate them) may come under, yet it is a ſpirit of Fornication; and it will lead out of the comely Order, into the Diſorder, and into the Defilements and Pollutions of the World, and into a Pit and a Snare: And for ſuch things ſake the Wrath of God will be reveal'd; and he will make ſuch Examples of his Vengeance: For, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>The Wife is bound by the Law ſo long as her Husband liveth; and if ſhe depart from him, and Marry another Man, ſhe is an Adultereſs, and a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the Law.</hi>—And therefore, my dear Friends (as I ſaid before) In that comely Order, in which <hi>you</hi> may adorn the Goſpel (and be kept in Favour with the Lord, and in Unity and Fellowſhip <hi>one</hi> with <hi>another,</hi> in his Spirit of Life) let all walk together; and in your places and ſtations, where the Lord hath ſet <hi>you</hi> and order'd <hi>you,</hi> therein abide with him, having the Loins of <hi>your</hi> Minds girt about with the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93507:34"/>
Truth it ſelf, and be zealous for the <hi>Honour thereof;</hi> and keep ſtedfaſt therein with the Lord, in Fear and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in Fervency and Simplicity, all being Examples one to another of Chaſtity, and Holineſs, and Godlineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that you may alſo be as Lights unto the World, anſwering the Witneſs of God in all, that none may have any thing againſt <hi>you,</hi> nor whereof to accuſe <hi>you,</hi> but only concerning <hi>your</hi> Obedience to the Law of <hi>your God;</hi> then will <hi>you</hi> have ſtrong <hi>Conſolation</hi> in the Lord, and great <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> towards him, and alſo in the ſight of all men; and the Lord will encreaſe <hi>your</hi> Spiritual Subſtance, and will alſo enlarge <hi>your Borders,</hi> by daily adding to <hi>your</hi> Number ſuch as ſhall be ſaved. And ſo, the Everlaſting God keep <hi>you</hi> all, and be with and amongſt <hi>you,</hi> and cauſe the plentious Showers of his <hi>Love</hi> to deſcend amongſt <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>refreſh</hi> and <hi>conſolate you</hi> therewith, that <hi>you</hi> may walk chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in his Preſence, and not with <hi>Bowed-down Souls;</hi> but that every one may poſſeſs his <hi>Soul</hi> in Peace, <hi>Amen.</hi>

ariſe; and whom he hath called out of the World, and ſeparated from its Wayes, Worſhips, and Traditions, and from the Defilements and Abominations thereof; that <hi>you</hi> might be a peculiar People unto himſelf, zealous of <hi>Good-works,</hi> that he might make known unto you that Myſtery of his Kingdom, which hath been hid from Ages and Generations paſt; that ſo <hi>you</hi> might ſtand faithful and true Witneſſes for his Name and Truth, and appear on his behalf in the <hi>Demonſtration of his own Life and Spirit;</hi> and that <hi>you</hi> might bear a faithful Teſtimony for that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Everlaſting, and Unchangeable Truth (which he hath manifeſted in your Inward Parts) not only in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Life, and Converſation, but alſo by ſuffering (for its ſake) whatſoever the Enemies thereof ſhall be permitted to inflict upon you, that thereby you may be approv'd not only in the ſight of God, but alſo of all <hi>good</hi> Men.</p>
                  <p>I ſay unto <hi>you,</hi> my beloved Friends, Prize your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and holy Calling, wherewith the Lord Almighty hath called <hi>you,</hi> and therein walk with God; and think it not hard nor ſtrange that he ſuffereth <hi>you</hi> ſo long to be try'd and exerciſed in Sufferings, as <hi>you</hi> have been hitherto, and are at this day, for <hi>your</hi> Teſtimony ſake; but look over it all, and lift up <hi>your</hi> heads above all; for the Lord hath aſſuredly an End in it, for his own Glory, and for the Exaltation and Spreading abroad that Bleſſed Truth, which we poſſeſs and live in, and which we ſuffer for; and alſo for the gathering into it many, who are yet far off from him, and Strangers unto him; ſo that whatſoever come, whether Bonds or Exilement, or what Exerciſes ſoever we meet withal, in this we may be ſatisfied, <hi>That it ſhall make for the Furtherance of the Goſpel of Christ, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93507:35"/>
for good unto all who continue their Obedience in him unto the End, and abide faithful unto Death.</hi> Wherefore, my dear Friends, If the Lord ſee it meet further to permit the Enemy to ſift and winnow us, and that we muſt be further tryed; nay, if he ſhould ſo order it, that we muſt be a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring People all our dayes; yet let none be weary or faint in your minds: <hi>For, In the Lord</hi> JEHOVAH who is certainly with us) <hi>there is Everlaſting ſtrength; and he fainteth not, neither is weary; but he giveth power to the Faint, and to him that hath no might he encreaſeth ſtrength:</hi> And ſo, let your Truſt be in him, and let that godly Reſolution be put on (by every one of <hi>you)</hi> that was in <hi>Job,</hi> who (when God ſuffer'd Satan to ſmite and afflict him) ſaid, <hi>Though thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee.</hi> And indeed, it's far better to ſuffer Perſecution with the <hi>People of God for good Conſcience towards him,</hi> then to dwell in the Tents of Wickedneſs, out of which God hath call'd and redeem'd us.</p>
                  <p>And my Friends, Conſider, Whither can any go, or whether can any flee, to eſcape Perſecutions? Certainly I know no place; neither do I believe there is any, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> except it be in the Tents of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>For, he that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus must ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> And if any, to eſcape Perſecutions and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſhould return to the Tents of Wickedneſs again; out of which, by the Power and Arm of God, they are brought; and ſhould diſert their Teſtimony, which God hath committed to them, to bear for his Name; it would happen unto them (as the Apoſtle ſaid) according to the old Proverb, <hi>The Dog is turned to his Vomit, and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire:</hi> And the Hand of the Lord would find ſuch out; and the Terrors of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would certainly ſeize upon them, and ſurprize them,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93507:36"/>
which would be manifold more grievous to be borne, then all the Sufferings that man can poſſibly inflict upon them: <hi>For its a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God:</hi> for out of his Hands no man can deliver; but out of the hands of Blood-thirſty and Wicked Men God can, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in his own time will deliver all who truſt in him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (my dear Friends) Put on Boldneſs and Courage, in the Name of the Lord, and ſtand valiant <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> for his Truth through all Sufferings, which is the thing he hath call'd <hi>you</hi> unto; that ſo <hi>you</hi> may anſwer the End for which he hath viſited <hi>you,</hi> and made known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto <hi>you:</hi> For conſider, Was it in Loving-kindneſs and Compaſſion unto <hi>you,</hi> that the Lord viſited <hi>you,</hi> and made choice of <hi>you</hi> to be Witneſſes for him, that his Name might be Glorified by <hi>you?</hi> Or elſe, Was it becauſe he had ſuch need of <hi>you,</hi> that he could not Glorifie his <hi>Name</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>you?</hi> Surely all who are of an underſtanding Heart will confeſs and acknowledge, that it was only in Love and Mercy unto <hi>you,</hi> that he thus made choice of <hi>you</hi> to ſuffer for his Name, and to Glorifie himſelf thereby, becauſe he can work for the Glory of his own Name, as he ſees meet, without <hi>you,</hi> or any of <hi>you;</hi> and can Magnifie his Power in the <hi>Deſtruction or Deſolation of a Nation or People</hi> (as in time paſt he hath done, and is doing at this day) though he takes no Delight therein; and therefore he hath no need of <hi>you</hi> for that End, but <hi>you</hi> have need of him: So that its only in Love and Compaſſion towards <hi>you,</hi> that he hath thus viſited <hi>you;</hi> and alſo, that <hi>you</hi> might have ſtrong Conſolation in <hi>your</hi> Obedience unto him through all Sufferings, which he hath called <hi>you</hi> unto.</p>
                  <p>And therefore my Beloved Friends, Gird up the Loins of <hi>your</hi> minds; and keep cloſe to, and ſtedfaſt with the Lord; and with the Eye of Faith <hi>look over</hi> all Tribulations, unto
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93507:36"/>
him that is inviſible, who will out-laſt them all, and will be with <hi>you</hi> in them, and through them all, and alſo, when they ſhall be no more: For certainly Friends, God hath determin'd, by and through theſe things, to exalt his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to get himſelf a Name in the Earth above every Name, that every Knee may bow, and every Tongue confeſs thereunto, unto his Praiſe and Glory. And he hath highly Honour'd us, in that he hath been pleaſed to make choice of us, and to accept of us to appear on his behalf, and (by Sufferings) to contend for his Cauſe, and to bear Teſtimony in the Life of his Spirit againſt all Idolatry and ſuperſtitious Inventions, which have gotten up in the dark Night of Apoſtacy; for he hath put the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Weapon into our hands, by the which the ſpiritual Wickedneſſes (that are in High Places) and the ſtrong Holds of Iniquity muſt be beat down; and in vain do the Inhabitants of the Earth Combine, or take Counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>to ſtop or limit</hi> this Work of God, which he hath begun, and is carrying on amongſt us; <hi>For he will certainly in the end be too hard for them; and they must, and ſhall aſſuredly fall before him, as their Predeceſſors did in times past (who oppos'd his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in our Fore-fathers)</hi> the Lord hath ſpoken it: <hi>And no Weapons that's form'd by them, or that they ſhall Form, ſhall ever proſper or prevail, ſo as to accompliſh their Decree;</hi> for God hath ſaid it.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my Friends, With <hi>one Heart,</hi> with <hi>one Mind,</hi> and with <hi>one Spirit</hi> ſerve ye the Lord in newneſs of Life; and continue the Aſſembling of <hi>your</hi> ſelves together in his Fear, to wait upon him, even as if theſe did not at all attend <hi>you.</hi> And none be Slack or Backward in <hi>your</hi> TE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIMONY herein for fear of Sufferings, leſt hereby <hi>you</hi> do not only purchaſe the Diſpleaſure of the LORD againſt <hi>your ſelves,</hi> but alſo, weaken the hand of others,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93507:37"/>
and thereby obtain'd the greater Condemnation: But remember what happen'd to the Fearful and Unbelieving Spies, who weaken'd the Hands of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, that they could not enter the promiſed Land; for, theſe things were written for our learning, that we ſhould not tempt God as they tempted him, and were deſtroy'd of the Deſtroyer. For certainly Friends, this I have long ſeen, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times declared alſo, that if any, to whom the Viſitation of God's Love hath reached, and who are now call'd to bear Witneſs to the Name of the Lord, by aſſembling themſelves together to wait upon him, and to worſhip him in Spirit, and have been perſwaded in their Conſciences by the Light of his Son, that it was their Duty ſo to do: I ſay, if ſuch (for fear of Suffering for their Teſtimony therein) ſhall forſake the Aſſembling of themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as the manner of ſome hath been) they will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring upon themſelves greater Sufferings, even from the hands of men, and more grievous to be borne, then thoſe which for the aſſembling of our ſelves together ſeem now to be threatned; except they wholy conform to worſhip the Image that is made unto the Beaſt, that had a Wound and doth live: and if ſo, then (as I ſaid before) the Lord God will aſſuredly find ſuch out, which will be more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and grievous to bear then the reſt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let all be Unanimous in your Teſtimony for the Lord, in this day of trying and proving; and be a Strength and an Encouragement one unto another, in that Gift of the Spirit of God, which from him you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; and <hi>you</hi> will certainly find and feel the Lord preſent with <hi>you,</hi> aſſiſting and furniſhing of <hi>you</hi> with all heavenly Vertues, which are needful or neceſſary for <hi>you</hi> in <hi>your</hi> preſent and future Exerciſes; and the Light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <hi>you</hi> will know to ſhine in <hi>your</hi> Tabernacle; and that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93507:37"/>
is very precious, and pleaſant, and comely to behold: And indeed, its that alone which cauſeth us to walk chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully through all Tryals and Exerciſes; and we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally know, that he hath not fail'd us hitherto, but hath been alwayes preſent with us to deliver us out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſtreſſes; yea, and aſſuredly will deliver us out of all in his own time, which haſteneth, when the meaſure of the Sufferings of our Lord and Maſter are fill'd up in us; for we muſt be throughly try'd and prov'd by Sufferings, and thereby be made manifeſt unto the Nations about us, to be the peculiar People of God, before the meaſure of our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings be full.</p>
                  <p>And my Friends, It is not the Purpoſe of God, by theſe Storms and Tempeſts, that beat upon the Building of <hi>God</hi> (or by the Sufferings that attend us) to ſuffer his Heritage or Building to be laid waſte: No; but thereby to beat down all Falſe Building, and Out-ſide Poſſeſſions, and to lay waſte the Hills and Barren Mountains, upon which the Whore ſits, and to make her deſolate; for they, by claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one againſt another, ſhall be broken one by another, or by biting and devouring one another, will be deſtroyed one of another: But you, my Beloved, who keep ſtedfaſt with the Lord through theſe things, ſhall thereby be manifeſted in the view of all Nations to be the Building of God, whoſe ſtanding is upon the Rock of Ages (the <hi>Mountain of his Holineſs)</hi> which all Storms, nor the Gates of Hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail againſt; and thereby he will alſo exalt his own <hi>Houſe (where</hi> Iſrael<hi>'s Fold is)</hi> above all the Hills and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Mountains (upon which we were ſometime ſcatter'd, and from which we are now gather'd by the Arm and Power of <hi>God)</hi> that ſo thereunto the gathering of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be, according to his <hi>Promiſe;</hi> for, was it not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93507:38"/>
foreſhewen by the Angel of the Lord unto his Servant <hi>John,</hi> in times paſt, <hi>That the Horns of the Beast, that ſhould make War with the Saints (and whom the Saints ſhould overcome) ſhould hate the Whore alſo, and make her deſolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Friends, Conſider this; and in Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that he is Faithful that hath promiſed, let us all wait upon the Lord, and be reſign'd up to be diſpos'd of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Counſel of his Will; and let him work, and carry on, and proſper his own Work, as he ſees meet: <hi>For its he alone that worketh all our Works for us, and in us; and he knows what is best for us, and of what we ſtand in need; and no Good Thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly:</hi> And we (who are in the Faith) know, that all things ſhall work for our <hi>good,</hi> who love him above all; therefore let us give up our All unto him, and caſt our Care upon him, who takes care for us; whoſe Wayes are unſearchable, and his Judgments paſt finding out.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, my Beloved Friends, Keep to, and watch the weighty Foundation, which ſtands ſure through all Storms and Tempeſts; and walk together in Love, and therein ſerve one another; and let none give place to that ſpirit which would exerciſe Lordſhip over another; for that is not the ſerving Spirit, that is to be ſubmitted unto, which beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into Love, Meekneſs, and Gentleneſs; but that ſpirit will rather beget a Root of Bitterneſs, which may defile many, and therefore not to be heeded: But the Love being dwelt in, which vaunteth not it ſelf, nor ſeeketh its <hi>own,</hi> but anothers <hi>good;</hi> that begets its own likeneſs: and in this <hi>you</hi> will ſtir up and provoke one another to Love, and to <hi>good</hi> and <hi>charitable Works;</hi> and then by <hi>you</hi> the Goſpel of God will be adorn'd, and <hi>you</hi> will have his <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in <hi>your</hi> hearts; which is of more Value, and greater Price with the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93507:38"/>
Upright in Heart, then all the Pleaſure of ſin, or Gain of Oppreſſion: And ſo, by <hi>your</hi> Stedfaſtneſs, Faithfulneſs, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and Simplicity in the Truth, <hi>you</hi> will even engage and provoke the Lord to appear on <hi>your</hi> behalfs, and to plead <hi>your</hi> Cauſe with <hi>your</hi> Adverſaries, and to ſhorten the dayes of the Wicked for <hi>your</hi> ſakes. And ſo the Almighty God of Love and Peace be with <hi>you</hi> all, and multiply the Riches of his Grace, Mercy, and Peace unto <hi>you</hi> all; that the <hi>Poor in Spirit</hi> may be enriched, the <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Feeble</hi> ſtrengthen'd, and the <hi>Sincere in Heart</hi> eſtabliſhed and confirmed: And unto him alone I do commit and commend <hi>you</hi> all, by whoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Love unfeigned I was at this time conſtrain'd to ſend this Epiſtle unto <hi>you,</hi> to ſtir <hi>you</hi> up to Faithfulneſs, Diligence, and Zeal towards God, and for his Cauſe; in which my <hi>love</hi> towards <hi>you,</hi> and my <hi>care</hi> for <hi>you</hi> is manifeſted: in which I alſo kindly ſalute <hi>you</hi> in the <hi>Bowels</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe Life is my Life, and whoſe Love hath filled my heart, in which I take my Solace and Reſt.</p>

                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:93507:39"/>
may be armed to fight the Lord's Battels, and be able to ſtand in the Evil Day, when <hi>you</hi> ſhall be tryed: And be <hi>you</hi> found watching every one in the Light and Gift of the Spirit of the Lord God, ſo will not that Day come upon any of <hi>you</hi> at unawares; but <hi>you</hi> will be found fitted and prepared to with-ſtand or reſiſt the Evil One in all his Wiles and Appearances, ſo that he ſhall not touch or harm <hi>your</hi> precious Life; for, the Lord Almighty, in whom <hi>you</hi> have believed, and in whom our Truſt and Confidence is, he will renew <hi>your</hi> Strength, and will be a Buckler unto <hi>you</hi> in the Day of Battel; and there will be no Faintneſs of Heart nor Fear in <hi>your</hi> Way, but the Mighty POWER of God <hi>you</hi> will feel, by which <hi>you</hi> will be able to tread upon the Necks of <hi>your</hi> Enemies, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and tread Satan under Foot.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, my Friends, Theſe things (in ſhort) were in my Heart to write unto <hi>you,</hi> in the full enjoyment of that Love with which <hi>you</hi> know right well we have oft been refreſhed together; aſſuring <hi>you</hi> all, that the ſame Bleſſed Preſence, and Power, and Love of God, in which I have been amongſt <hi>you,</hi> and by which I have been called from amongſt <hi>you,</hi> to bear Teſtimony to the Bleſſed Name of the Lord (by which we are called) even to the Nations afar off) is ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me; in which Love this is farther in my Heart to ſay unto <hi>you</hi> (although <hi>you</hi> may very well know it already, yet that none may grow forgetful) that God hath many Wayes to try the Faith of his People, both inwardly and outwardly; and oft-times ſuffereth the Enemy to work and exerciſe his power for that End; and the Enemy will work very ſubtilly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93507:40"/>
if poſſible to deprive <hi>you</hi> of <hi>your</hi> Peace with God: But my Friends, You keeping in the Power of an Endleſs Life (with which God hath certainly viſited <hi>you)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>your</hi> Underſtandings will be kept clear, and <hi>your</hi> Hearts open towards God; and there all the Wiles and Subtilties of the Enemy will be ſeen and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he defy'd and rejected, and trampled upon in the Eternal Power of God: And herein <hi>you</hi> will be Victorious and Conquerers over all Temptations, and over all Aſſaults of the Wicked one: And herein <hi>you</hi> will have free Acceſs to God, and Boldneſs towards God; and <hi>you</hi> will all meet at the Throne of Grace, in the Unity of the Faith, in which <hi>you</hi> will have Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with the Lord. And here will be no Rent, nor Diviſion, nor Striving of Spirits; Nay, that muſt not enter which would have the preheminence over others; for that will cauſe Diviſions: but that muſt live in all, and over all, which will be Servant to all; and therein are the Bleſſings of the Lord enjoyed, and his Peace witneſſed; and he will fill <hi>your</hi> Hearts with his Love, and cauſe his Heritage to flouriſh; and will make <hi>you</hi> as a watered Garden, whoſe Springs do not fail.</p>

                  <p>ALL who are convinced of the Truth of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, and have believed the Report that hath been given amongſt <hi>you</hi> concerning the great Salvation of God; and who have been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>your</hi> Hearts and Conſciences, by the Light and Spirit of the Lord, that it is <hi>your</hi> Duty unto God to meet together to wait upon him, and to worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth, and have been drawn by this Spirit of Truth to the performance of this Religious Duty.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, my Friends, You know right well, that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and Plentifully the Lord did appear amongſt <hi>you</hi> in <hi>your</hi> Aſſemblies, when <hi>you</hi> firſt began the Exerciſes thereof; and he made his Power known amongſt <hi>you;</hi> and thereby wrought in <hi>your</hi> Hearts mightily and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to the bringing down and ſubjecting of that which had darkened and vail'd Life and Immortality from <hi>your</hi> ſight and view; and by which <hi>you</hi> were made Strangers
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93507:42"/>
thereunto: And this ſame Power of God, through the effectual working and operating of it, did raiſe Life, and bring Immortality to Light in <hi>you;</hi> ſo that <hi>you</hi> were no longer as Strangers unto it, but were brought into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance therewith; and <hi>your</hi> hearts and ſouls were aboundantly Refreſhed and Conſolated therewith; and through the ariſing thereof and thereby <hi>you</hi> became more fully confirmed in <hi>your</hi> firſt Faith, which was begotten in <hi>you</hi> by the Word; and then a Godly Zeal and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more fervently aroſe in <hi>your</hi> hearts, to continue this Practiſe, and perform this Duty of Aſſembling <hi>your ſelves</hi> together, which at firſt <hi>you</hi> believed <hi>you</hi> ought to do; and then did the Lord ſo eminently appear amongſt <hi>you,</hi> that by his Spirit he ſealed unto <hi>you your</hi> Acceptance with him in the performance of this Duty; and then <hi>you</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw and believ'd, <hi>That whatſoever Suffering ſhould come upon you for the continuance of this Religious Exerciſe, yet you ought to perſevere and continue therein, and to hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of your first Faith; and alſo the practiſe of the thing which you believed to be your Duty unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>you</hi> right well know, That many Tryals and Sufferings have attended <hi>you</hi> ſince <hi>you</hi> firſt began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for this Faith, and to make a Profeſſion thereof, and to practiſe the thing which <hi>you</hi> believed was <hi>your</hi> Duty unto God; but the Lord was alwayes with <hi>you,</hi> and aſſiſted <hi>you</hi> with his Spirit and Power in the mid'ſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even all who were ſingly reſign'd up unto him, and did perſevere and continue in their due Obedience unto him; and he never left nor forſook ſuch in any Tryal or Tribulation, but alwayes miniſtred unto them in the mid'ſt thereof according to their neceſſities; and this I know the Witneſs of God in all the Upright in Heart ſhall ſeal unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93507:42"/>And now my dear Friends, Brethren, and Siſters, the Conſideration and Remembrance of theſe things are ſufficient to encourage every one, and to ſtir them up, and provoke them to hold faſt their Godly Reſolution, which they put on in the beginning; and to perſevere and continue in all Faithful Obedience in this Duty, while they have Liberty and Opportunity ſo to do: And if for <hi>your</hi> Faithfulneſs, and Obedience therein, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be ſuffer'd to caſt <hi>you</hi> into Priſon, and to Exile <hi>you</hi> for the Goſpel's ſake, <hi>Yet the Lord will be with you there,</hi> he hath ſaid it, and will perform his word; ſo that <hi>you</hi> need not fear what Man can do unto <hi>you;</hi> for the Lord, will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort <hi>you</hi> in the midſt of all <hi>your</hi> Sufferings, as in times paſt: but if any draw back, or fall from their firſt Stedfaſtneſs, and forſake the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, for fear of Sufferings and Peſecutions, and think thereby to eſcape the Penalty of the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws of men; then will the Lord take no pleaſure in ſuch; but will withdraw his Love and Preſence; and his wonted Goodneſs will he withhold from ſuch; and inſtead of Peace, there will be Trouble unto them; and Sorrow inſtead of Joy; and inſtead of Plenty and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Riches of God's Grace, there will be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and Emptineſs, and Want; and Barrenneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Fruitfulneſs: For He, with whom we have to do, can turn a Fruitful Land into Barrenneſs, for the Iniquity of them that dwell therein: And indeed, it is better to dye for the Cauſe of God, then to live out of his Favour.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my Dear Friends, All dwell and watch in the Light, our firſt Principle, that the ſubtilty of the Enemy may be diſcover'd thereby, in all his Aſſaults
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93507:43"/>
and Alurement; and keep in a ſtate reſign'd unto the Lord, out of all Reaſonings and Conſultations with <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> for they let in Temptations, and thereby <hi>you</hi> may be ſnared; but as <hi>you</hi> ſtand ſingly given up to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord through all Tryals and Sufferings, that may come upon <hi>you</hi> for the Goſpels ſake, there will be nothing wanting unto <hi>you</hi> that appertains to the Peace, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to the Joy, and Salvation of <hi>your Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Friends, This I have ſeen in the Light of God's Truth and Salvation, and this hath been long upon my Heart to declare unto <hi>you,</hi> That if any are any whit wavering in their Minds, they may be fore-warned, that if the Enemy ſhould ſo far prevail with any, as to put them upon ſeeking out a Way to eſcape the preſent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which attend the Flock of God, as <hi>Impriſonment, Exilement, &amp;c.</hi> yet I ſay unto <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> ſhall find it to be true, that the ſame Enemy will find out another Way to bring ſuch wholy to conform to his Worſhip and Image ſet up; or elſe will bring a worſe Suffering upon them, and more grievous to be borne then that which now is threatned.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my Dear Friends, Partakers of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Calling in Chriſt Jeſus, Put on Valour, and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Courage for the Cauſe of God which we are now engaged in; and ſtand faſt in that Liberty wherewith Chriſt our Lord hath made <hi>you</hi> free; and be nothing terrified becauſe of the Rage of the Enemies of God's Truth; but whereunto <hi>you</hi> have already attain'd there abide, and hold faſt that which <hi>you</hi> have already receiv'd, leſt <hi>you</hi> loſe <hi>your</hi> Crown; and keep out of <hi>Conſultings</hi> with <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> leſt <hi>you</hi> be thereby entangled with the Yoke of Bondage; for, the Fleſh is weak, and not willing to bear Sufferings; but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93507:43"/>
the Spirit is willing; and as it is enclin'd unto, and obey'd, and follow'd in its Motions and Leadings, it makes willing to bear and endure all things, and to ſuffer the loſs of all things for the ſake of the Lord Jeſus; rhete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none (<hi>Eſau</hi> like) ſell his Birthright for a Meſs of Pottage; but like Worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> wreſtle with the Lord in his own Strength, that <hi>you</hi> may prevail as Princes, and obtain the Inheritance incorruptible, that never fadeth away; which is the earneſt Deſire and Prayer of him, who dearly loves and ſalutes the whole Flock of God in every Region and Quarter of the Earth.</p>

his Benefits, and Mercies, and Goodneſs been unto <hi>you;</hi> and often hath he cauſed <hi>your</hi> Cups to overflow; ſo that <hi>you</hi> could ſay in <hi>your</hi> Hearts, <hi>That you had received your ſouls De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and were fully ſatisfied; and your Souls did Bleſs, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and Praiſe the Name of the Lord, the God of your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who hath done ſo great things for you, even beyond decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; who brought deliverance unto you in the time of great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Diſtreſs; when you were compaſſed about with many Sorrows, and ſaw none to comfort you; when you were even in the horrible Pit, and ſaw your ſelves at a great Diſtance from your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker (by reaſon of Sin and Tranſgreſſion) and were in your own eyes even ſhut up in Darkneſs and in Obſcurity, then did the Diſtreſſed cry unto the Lord, and he heard the Cries and Groanings thereof, and was moved with Compaſſion towards his own Seed, and he aroſe in his mighty Power, and ſtretched forth his Glorious Arm, and reached unto his own Elect, and thereby brought Deliverance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:</hi> And ſo the Oppreſſed came to be ſet free, and the Diſtreſſed to be ſet at liberty; and this was the Day of Glad-tidings unto <hi>you,</hi> and the acceptable Year of the Lord, though a Day of Vengeance came upon the Wicked and Ungodly, and upon that part which had led <hi>your</hi> minds aſtray, and to tranſgreſs the pure Law and holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord And ſo, my Dearly Beloved, The Lord having done ſo great things for <hi>you,</hi> in bringing <hi>you</hi> out of the <hi>Egyptian Darkneſs,</hi> and out of the waſte howling Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and hath brought <hi>you</hi> into a Plentiful Land, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with Milk and Honey; and with the good things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath he ſatisfied <hi>you,</hi> and aboundantly filled <hi>you</hi> time after time; therefore now rememember, and beware that <hi>you</hi> forget not the Lord, nor his wonderous Works; but dwell in his eternal <hi>Power,</hi> by which he hath done theſe things for <hi>you;</hi> and walk in all <hi>Humility</hi> before him, anſwering the <hi>motion</hi>

And ſo <hi>you</hi> will ſee that all theſe Tryals and Sufferings which ſhall come upon any of <hi>you,</hi> ſhall work for <hi>your</hi> everlaſting Good, and for the Glory of the Lord, and ſhall make for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the Glorious Goſpel of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> who is the Captain of our Salvation, and was made perfect through Suffering, and is now ſet upon his Throne, at the Right-Hand of the Father, to judge the World in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; to whoſe Scepter and Dominion all Powers, Thrones, and Dominions muſt bow, and bend, and become ſubject; for the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let none faint in their minds, becauſe of the preſent Rage of the Adverſary, but look unto him who lifts up the Head above the Raging Waves of the Sea, and <hi>you</hi> will ſee him to ariſe, who will rebuke the Rage of the Devourer, and will cauſe a great Calm.</p>

neither be Diſmayed becauſe of the proſperity of the Wicked, whoſe Day ſhall paſs away ſwiftly, and ſhall be no more: but every one put on Strength, and Courage, and Boldneſs in the Name of the Lord; and as valiant Souldiers, endure Hardſhip, and fight the Good Fight of FAITH, and lay holy on Eternal Life; for the Lord God Almighty is with us, and take our part; and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly will fight our Battels for us, before whom all the Nations of the Earth are but as the Drop of a Bucket; and therefore its in vain for them to contend with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who is on our ſide, and is greater in us then he that is in the World; whoſe eternal Glory and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is now revealed; Praiſes and Halelujahs to the Moſt High forever.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Ariſe, ariſe, thou Seed of the Covenant, ariſe and ſhine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is ariſen upon thee; though the Earth be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Darkneſs, and groſs Darkneſs be over the People, yet the Lord is become thy Everlaſting Light, and thy God thy Glory: Wherefore ſhake thy ſelf from the Duſt of Earth, and put on thy beautiful Garments, Oh <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the holy City; for this I teſtifie in the Name of the Lord, <hi>That henceforth there ſhall not come into thee the Uncircumciſed, nor the Unclean; but thou ſhalt be called the City of God, the Place wherein his Honour dwells.</hi> Wherefore all ye Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, my Fellow Citizens, and beloved Brethren and Siſters, with whom my Life is bound up, and with whom my ſoul rejoyceth; who are ſurrounded with the great Salvation of God, and know it to be the Wall of this Holy City, the Gates whereof is Praiſe, and ſtand open Night and Day, though the Unclean cannot enter into it: I ſay unto <hi>you</hi> all, Let the High Praiſes of God be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93507:48"/>
in <hi>your</hi> Mouthes; and ceaſe not to make mention of the Wonders of the Lord, and of his Works, which he hath wrought for <hi>you;</hi> and tell of his, Goodneſs and Loving-kindneſs, and ſpeak of his Praiſes; that the Glory of his Appearance in <hi>you</hi> may be admired amongſt the <hi>Heathen,</hi> in this the Day of the Lords Power, wherein his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Majeſty is ſeen, of which we are Eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore can we not ceaſe to make known his Power and Coming, that others alſo may be turned to the Light of God in them, their to wait for his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>And though there be a Generation that would have us ſilenced, as the Phariſees would have Chriſt to rebuke his Diſciples, when they went Triumphing to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the High Praiſes of God were in their Mouthes, yet they were not to hold their peace, but to go on, and preach his Name amongſt all Nations, that People might be turned unto God. And though they were again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards charged to ſpeak no more in his Name; yet they conſidered, <hi>That it was better to obey God than Man:</hi> For they who followed the Lamb were Called, and Choſen, and Faithful; and they loved not their Lives unto the Death, but went on boldly preaching in the Name of Jeſus, not regarding the Threatnings of corrupt Man, but had reſpect unto the Lord above all, who is the ſame at this day as ever he was; and his Faithfulneſs is the ſame forever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are truly Faithful unto him.</p>
                  <p>And his wonderous Works, and Majeſty, and Glory is now ſeen by us, in this our Day, even as by them in the dayes of old; wherefore let the ſame Courage, Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Faithfulneſs appear amongſt <hi>you,</hi> as was in them; though I do not at all upbraid <hi>you,</hi> neither was it in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93507:49"/>
my Heart ſo to do; but as a Brother of the ſame Root and Off-ſpring with <hi>you</hi> (who are begotten by the ſame Word, and brought forth by the ſame eternal Womb, which is Holy forever) do I exhort <hi>you</hi> in Bowels of the ſame tender Love, with which <hi>our</hi> Hearts are filled, to continue in Stedfaſtneſs, &amp; hold faſt <hi>your</hi> Integrity in Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs unto the End every one in <hi>your</hi> ſeveral Stations and Callings, that <hi>you</hi> may adorn the <hi>Glorious Goſpel</hi> of Peace and of Salvation; that ſo, <hi>you</hi> dwelling in the Pure, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Heavenly Power, thereby <hi>your</hi> Lips may be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>your</hi> Mouthes may ſhew forth his Praiſe; that his Name may be known to be great in the Aſſemblies of his Saints, and in the Congregations of the Righteous; that ſo Nations may be gather'd unto him, and Kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brightneſs of his Riſing; that ſo the Name of the <hi>Lord</hi> may be ſpread even to the Ends of the Earth, which is now to be exalted above every Name, to which every Knee muſt bow, and all Tongues confeſs.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all <hi>you</hi> my beloved Friends, Brethren, and Siſters, who are of the Royal Off-ſpring, and of the Holy Seed, which is the Heir of the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Father:</hi> I ſay unto <hi>you</hi> all, dwell in the feeling of the Immortal <hi>Birth,</hi> every one in <hi>your</hi> own particulars; for therein the Heirſhip ſtands, and to that the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is ſure; and as <hi>you</hi> keep Faithfully joyn'd unto it, therein <hi>you</hi> will know the <hi>Heavenly Dominion</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which goes over the Powers of the Earth and Darkneſs (with which the Earth is cover'd) and will give <hi>you</hi> to ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were.</p>
                  <p>And here the Son is known, who was glorified with the Father before the World began, and who is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of his Father's Subſtance, and in whom the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93507:49"/>
Fulneſs of the Godhead dwells, and unto whom all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Heaven and in Earth is given. And this is he, who now is come in Power and great Glory, of whoſe Power and Coming <hi>you</hi> are his Cloud of Witneſſes, who know the Birth of the Immortal <hi>Seed;</hi> and it is becauſe of this that the <hi>Heathen</hi> rages, and the Nations are angry; and therefore do they Revile, and Perſecute, and Smite with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs, according as it is written, <hi>He that is born after the Fleſh perſecutes him that is born after the Spirit:</hi> And theſe things they do unto <hi>you,</hi> becauſe they know not him, of whoſe Coming <hi>you</hi> are Witneſſes. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Dwell ye in the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit ye that have the ſenſe and feeling of the working and operating thereof in <hi>your</hi> inward Parts in any meaſure, and anſwer the Motions thereof in all things; for therein <hi>your</hi> Peace and <hi>Conſolation</hi> conſiſteth, and <hi>your</hi> Everlaſting Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which none can hinder <hi>you</hi> of, as <hi>you</hi> obey the Truth according to the Motions of the Spirit of Truth; and therein walking, <hi>you</hi> will not fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh; but the Croſs will be dwelt in, and Self-denyal will be known and witneſſed, and the Power of the Lord will be felt, which makes willing to come into the Obedience of the Croſs, whereby the contrary part will be crucified; and mortified and the Old Man will be wholy put off with his Deeds, and the New Man put on, which is created after God in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. And ſo here walking every one in <hi>your</hi> own meaſures, in Faithfulneſs to the Lord, <hi>you</hi> will feel the Lord adminiſtring unto <hi>you</hi> of his rich Vertue to the filling of <hi>your</hi> Hearts, and to the making of <hi>your</hi> Cups to overflow; for this I teſtifie unto you, and that by the Spirit of the Lord, That the Lord's Love, and Mercies, and the Riches of his Grace did never
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93507:50"/>
more abound in the Hearts of his People, in any Age or Generation, than it doth in this our Day, in the Hearts of all who obey and follow him; and give up freely unto him in all his Leadings and Requirings.</p>
                  <p>And therefore once more I ſay unto <hi>you,</hi> my Beloved Ones, give up in ſingleneſs to follow the Lord, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he leads <hi>you</hi> unto. And walk with him in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his own Spirit of Life; and let the Righteouſneſs of God go before <hi>you,</hi> and his Everlaſting Glory ſhall be <hi>your</hi> Reward.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, Dear Hearts, Feel <hi>your</hi> ſelves covered with the Spirit of Life; for that ſhall and will remain when all falſe Coverings ſhall be ript off, and all empty Profeſſions, and out-ſide Shews will wither, and have an end, and come to nothing. Therefore ye, as Wiſe Virgins, have Oyle in <hi>your</hi> Lamps; and ſee that <hi>your</hi> Lamps be kept trimmed and burning, that ſo <hi>you</hi> may be kept ready at all times, to enter in with the Bridegroom into his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Chamber; ſo will <hi>you</hi> have Joy, and Felicity, and Gladneſs of Heart; and no cauſe of Sorrow will there be while <hi>you</hi> enjoy the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of <hi>your</hi> Souls preſent with <hi>you;</hi> who will be an everlaſting <hi>Comforter</hi> unto <hi>you,</hi> with whom <hi>you</hi> will know an Everlaſting REST: And that Peace <hi>you</hi> will be Heirs of (and poſſeſs) which paſſeth the Underſtanding of the World; and in this <hi>you</hi> will have <hi>ſtrong Conſolation</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> even that which can never be blaſted: but whatſoever flouriſheth, and may ſeem proſperous for a time, if it be not in and by the Power of the Lord, that will the Lord blaſt, and cauſe to wither as the Flower of the Graſs; and this <hi>your</hi> Eyes ſhall ſee, if <hi>you</hi> keep in the eternal Power of the Lord, which keeps the inviſible Eye open, which alone perceives the things
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93507:50"/>
of God. So in the pure Power of the Lord dwell and keep, that <hi>you</hi> may be kept in a clear Diſcerning, and ſenſible of <hi>your</hi> own particular Conditions, and how it ſtands with <hi>you</hi> in the Preſence of the Lord, that <hi>you</hi> may know <hi>your</hi> Peace and Unity with him, and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that ſo all being kept in the Power and Unity of the one Spirit, in that <hi>you</hi> may exhort one another, and ſo much the more as <hi>you</hi> ſee the Day approaching; that ſo <hi>you</hi> may be ſtrengthened one by another, and may build up one another in the Precious Living Truth, and therein edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one another in Love, that ſo <hi>you</hi> may ſtand over the World, and over that part in which the Enmity ſtands, which is againſt God; ſo will it appear unto all men, <hi>That you are the People which God hath Bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now my dearly beloved Friends, Theſe few Lines have I written unto <hi>you</hi> from the aboundings of the Love of my heavenly Father, which he hath ſhed abroad in my heart towards <hi>you</hi> all, and by this Love only was I conſtrain'd thereunto; wherein (in ſome meaſure) is manifeſted that real and unfeigned Love which dwells in me, and daily extends it ſelf unto the whole Houſhold of Faith, whereſoever they are; with whom I am at this time even wrapt up with the Garment of Praiſe: And in the pure U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Spirit of Life, and Endleſs Unſpotted Love, do I purely ſalute <hi>you</hi> all, leaving <hi>you</hi> to the Protection of the Almighty, whoſe tender Care is over all his, and watcheth over his own Inheritance Night and Day; ſo that the Devourer cannot prevail to lay it waſte nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let <hi>your</hi> Confidence and Truſt be in him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and continue <hi>you</hi> in the Grace of God which hath appeared, and the Sufficiency thereof <hi>you</hi> will more and

more ſee and witneſs daily. And Bleſſed (in the Name of the Lord God Almighty) are all they whoſe Truſt and Confidence is in him alone; for they ſhall never be aſhamed nor confounded, but ſhall be as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which cannot be moved.</p>
                  <p>So the Lord God Almighty of Heaven and Earth keep <hi>you</hi> all, and preſerve <hi>you</hi> all in the enjoyment of the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Peace, where <hi>you</hi> all may know the Reſt to remain, that neither Stormes can diſturb <hi>you,</hi> nor Tempeſts make <hi>you</hi> afraid; in which I am with <hi>you</hi> all who are of the Family of God.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore I ſay unto you all, my beloved Friends, Lambs and Babes of God, be patient, and therein wait upon God, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and the day of a great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is at hand, wherein he will do, and bring to paſs ſuch things which cannot be believed by many, though they ſhould be told unto them: Therefore murmur not againſt the Lord in any wiſe, becauſe of theſe things which are come to paſs, and happened unto us, nor becauſe of the greatneſs of the rage of the Adverſary, for it is becauſe he hath but a very ſhort time; and though you have born long, and ſuffered much in divers kinds, and the oppreſſive yoke of Antichriſt is not yet removed nor taken away; yet I ſay, my Friends, Fear not, nor faint not in your minds, but endure to the end in the Faith and Patience of Jeſus, and when the things determined ſhall be accompliſhed, and the meaſure of iniquity ſhall be filled up, then ſhall the day of a great deliverance come unto you, and your eyes ſhall ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a quiet habitation, the praiſe of the whole Earth: And then ſhall the Lord God Almighty be known to reign in the Kingdoms of Men, and his Glory ſhall ſpread forth its ſelf to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93507:55"/>
ends of the World, and be declared of throughout all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth; and the Knowledge of God ſhall cover the Earth as the waters cover the Sea. Theſe ſayings are faithful and true, and things that muſt ſhortly come to paſs and be fulfilled, the Lord hath ſpoken it, and bleſſed are all they who believe and obey the Word of the Goſpel, and wait for the fulfilling of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, my dear Friends, dwell low in God's Fear, and in his Covenant of Light into which you are gathered; and wait to receive his pure, Divine, Heavenly wiſdom to order you, and be you ordered thereby, and that will keep you out of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, ſo that none will be lifted up above what is meet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Promiſes of God, nor yet be caſt down becauſe of the threatnings of the Enemy, that ſo you may neither turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to the right hand, nor to the left, but that you may walk on in the even way, which is the path of peace, and feel the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life which is of God, to remain and abide in you; ſo will you be kept freſh and lively in the beauty of Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhine as Lights to the World: For you are the Salt with which the Earth muſt be ſeaſoned, and with which all things muſt be ſalted to make it ſavory unto God, and acceptable unto him: For as the ſtate of the World is in which they now lie, they are unſavoury unto God, and not at all a pleaſant ſmell, neither hath he any delight in their Sacrifices, for even their prayers are abominable unto him, and their ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies he hath no pleaſure in, but his ſoul even loaths and abhors them, and he will certainly work a Reformation is the Earth, and he will beat down <hi>Babylon</hi> with a mighty blow, and will bring a great deſolation upon her, and amongſt her Merchants ſhall the noiſe of a great howling be heard, and all her delicacies ſhall come to nought, and all her coſtly attire (the works of cunning Workmen) ſhall be conſumed; for ſhe is come into remembrance before the Lord, and as ſhe hath loved blood, ſo muſt ſhe have blood to drink; for the Cup of God's Fury is already filled into the hands of the Saints of the Moſt High, to pour out unto her: And as ſhe hath lived deliciouſly, and glorified her ſelf; ſo much torment and ſorrow muſt ſhe have given unto her; yea, ſhe ſhall have doubled unto her according to all her works, and then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93507:56"/>
ſhall the Saints, Prophets and holy Apoſtles rejoyce over, when God ſhall have avenged us on her.</p>
                  <p>And now, my beloved Friends, this I ſay unto you in and by the Spirit of the Lord, That the time haſtens and draweth nigh in which theſe things muſt be brought to paſs, yet nevertheleſs the things decreed and determined of the Lord muſt firſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: So that although the power of darkneſs hath been long working, and doth ſtill work, as it were, in a prevalent manner, by which ſufferings and tribulations are brought upon us; yet I ſay, it is by the permiſſion of the hand of the Lord, that theſe things are ſo, and he hath an end in ſuffering it ſo to be, and that for his own glory; and who ſhall ſay him nay for ſo doing, or reaſon with him about matters of ſo deep concernment, ſeeing his way is hid from man, and is not known unto any, but only them unto whom he reveals it?</p>
                  <p>But this, my Friends, I know from the Lord, That he hath an intent and purpoſe of good unto us thereby, and why then ſhould not we all be content, and willingly ſubmit unto the hand of the Lord, whoſe Fatherly care is over all his. And truly Friends, though we may ſay we have ſuffered long by the afflicting hand of our Enemies, and their ſtroke hath fallen hard upon many of us, and that great ſufferings and afflictions ſeem ſtill to attend us; yet my Friends (bleſſed be the Lord) my heart is not at all troubled at theſe things, neither do thoughts of fear enter; becauſe I ſee the end of the Lord in it. And I know it is not contrary, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the determination of the Almighty that theſe things are ſo: Yet I dare not but acknowledge, that they by whom theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are inflicted upon us, do go beyond their bounds and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that is the very thing with will break them, when they have filled up their meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, my beloved Brethen, be you all like-minded with me in this matter; and ſettle it in your heart, to bear all things with patience and contentedneſs, that may yet come upon you, for the farther tryal of your Faith; and put on Valour, and Courage, and Boldneſs, and be ſtrong in the Lord, &amp; in the Power of his Might, and be nothing daunted before the face of your Enemies; but let them ſee your courage in the Spirit of the Lamb, and in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: For the Lord is aſſuredly with us, and amongſt us,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93507:56"/>
and will be an Enemy unto our Enemies: And what is it makes a people more dreadful and terrible, then to have the Preſence of the Lord with them? and truly Friends this I know from the Lord, and this I have receive from God, That he will yet make his people a terror to the Nations round about them; and they ſhall come bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bending, and ſhall deſire to be at League and Covenant with all thoſe who are and abide in Covenant with God, becauſe they ſhall know that God is with us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all, my Friends, abide in that where you may have and enjoy the preſence of the Lord and know it to continue always with you, who will be your everlaſting Comforter, and your Stay, and Strength in all ſtates and conditions; and you will not be left comfortleſs by him, though you may be yet further tryed, and ſometimes, it may be, caſt down; yet you will not be forſaken that truſt in him, and repoſe confidence in him; for he will be always with you, and will give you of his Counſel and Wiſdom, by which you will be directed to walk in the path of peace, and all occaſions of ſtumbling will be removed out of the way; and you will not at all think it ſtrange that the Lord ſuffereth you ſo to be tryed, for you will ſee the end and purpoſe of God therein, and ſo in ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Heavenly Will in all things, you will have ſatisfaction, peace, joy and content: But if the reaſoning part enter, that will ſoon darken the underſtanding, and vail the life, and the Counſel of God will be obſcure to thee, &amp; thou wilt not ſee the end of the Lord in his thus exerciſing of thee, and then ſufferings will be grievous and hard to be born, and the Murmurer will get up, that will murmur againſt God, and peace will flye from thee, and the afflicting hand of God will be upon thee alſo, becauſe of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs; and ſuch a ſtate is worſe then his that never knew the way of Truth: Wherefore conſult not with fleſh and blood, but in patience continue to the end, in will-doing, and none to be weary therein, but be circumſpect and diligent every one in your minds and ſpirits, and watch unto prayer, that you enter not into the temptation when it cometh, for your Adverſary the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lyon, and waits to devour, and lurks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the precious life, and will loſe no opportunity that poſſibly he can get to make an enterance upon you, to deprive you of your treaſure: Wherefore I ſay, Reſiſt him ſtedfaſt in the Faith, and be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93507:57"/>
you armed with the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to withſtand him in all his appearances; for now he will beſt in him with all his force &amp; might, and will make many great oppoſitions and aſſaults both within and without, if by any means to beguile you as he did <hi>Eve</hi> in the beginning: but as you dwell in him who is the quickning Spirit, in him the Devil hath no part, neither can he prevail there; ſo in him your ſafety is from the devourer; for he that is begotten of God into this quickning Spirit, and therein abides, he it is that keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And ſo my dear Friends, I am full of unfeigned love to you all, and my heart is indeed greatly enlarged towards you with the goodneſs and Love of God which abounds in me, and not in me only, but in all the Flock of my Fathers Fold, who are faithful and upright-hearted to him, &amp; a table richly deckt he has ſpread before us in the midſt of our Enemies; and what could we more deſire then the Lord hath done for us, and promiſed to do? He hath begotten us unto himſelf, and nouriſhed and brought us up unto this ſtate in which we now ſtand; and this he hath done by his own right hand of power, and hath formed us for his praiſe, to be a peculiar people unto himſelf: And now this he requireth of every one, That you walk worthy of his Love, that it riſe not in judgement againſt any one; and that every one anſwer his requirings, and the leadings and drawings of his Spirit; ſo ſhall his Love continue with you for ever, and you ſhall be as a watered Garden, whoſe ſprings do not fail: So to the Lord do I reſign you up, and commit you all to the word of his Grace, who will preſerve you and keep you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by who truſt in him, and the almighty Arm of God be amongſt you, and proſper and perſerve you unto his everlaſting <hi>Kingdom, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this was I moved by the Spirit of the Lord to write unto you, as a Salutation of my endeared Love unto you, and that the things that muſt ſhortly come to paſs, might be ſignified unto you before-hand, and that you may be refreſhed thereby: And ſo in the Faith thereof I reſt and remain.</p>

                  <p>ANd Friends, not in any wiſe to forſake the aſſembling of your ſelves together, in as much as you know the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefit you have received thereby; and you know full well, that it was the uſual practice of the Servants of God by whom you were begotten into the Truth, and inſtructed therein (of whom ſome remain amongſt you unto this day, and ſome are fallen aſleep) I ſay, it was their uſual manner to exhort you, and to ſtir you up to that obedience of aſſembling your ſelves together: And when did you meet together to wait upon God, and your hearts kept ſtayed upon him, but that you received your expected end? Wherefore let the remembrance of theſe things encourage you to continue in this well-doing while you have a being and Liberty ſo to do: And though there were ſuch in ages paſt, whoſe manner was to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together, and ſome ſuch there are at this day alſo: Yet my Friends, let not them be your example to walk by; but every one to walk as you had and have them for examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, who begat you into the Truth, and by whom the Way of Life hath been made known unto you; and be ye Followers of them even as they were, and are of Chriſt: For this, my Friends, I ſay unto you, There are ſome ſprung up amongſt us who have in effect, laboured to diſſwade Friends from their uſual way and manner of meeting and aſſembling together, with whoſe ſpirit and proceedings therein we have not unity, but muſt in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt Jeſus the Lamb of God, give teſtimony againſt them, and forewarn you not to receive that ſpirit which goeth about to divert you from your uſual way and manner of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together, in which you have had the comfort of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and received the Juſtification of Life, and thereby your growth hath been much added unto: So that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93507:58"/>
my Friends, that Spirit which would turn you aſide from this godly practiſe (of aſſembliug together) is a dangerous ſpirit, and is not of God, whatſoever it pretend, or though it cover it ſelf with never ſo fair expreſſions: Wherefore, my dear Friends, have Salt within you to ſavour withal, and keep your firſt Love, and your firſt Faith, through which you received life eternal; and hold faſt your firſt ſimplicity, and your former integrity, and gad not abroad to change your ways, but meet together in the Name and Fear of the Lord, as your wonted manner hath been; ſo ſhall you find the preſence of God with you in your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, as in the days paſt; and his wonted goodneſs and love you will feel, which will warm your hearts, and refreſh your ſouls; by which you will be kept living unto him, and a good ſauour, and be to the praiſe of his Name, who is God over all bleſſed for ever.</p>

                  <head>To all the Babes in Chriſt, AND CHILDREN of LIGHT, Who are young in the Truth, and but of late convinced of it, A Tender Salutation and Exhortation.</head>
                  <p>MY beloved Friends, Babes, and Lambs of Chriſt, with whom I have travelled, for the bringing forth of the Birth which is immortal, and which is the right Heir of the everlaſting Kingdom of God, and for the redemption and freedom of the Seed which is incorruptible, from under the dark power, where it hath been held, and lain in bondage, and in captivity, that it might come forth into its freedom, and Glorious Liberty, to ſerve the Lord, and to ſacrifice in Righteouſneſs unto him; I ſay, for the Redemption and Freedom thereof, have we laboured and travelled together, whom the Lord ſent forth amongſt you, in his own Name, and Power, and Authority, and therein, and therewith have we reached unto you, and the Spirit of Life from God through
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93507:59"/>
us hath breathed upon the Slain in you, and entred into the Witneſs, and raiſed the Dead incorruptible; and now the Dead being raiſed in you, and the Living, True, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs being felt by you, wait every one, that thereby you may come to be changed; and wholly tranſlated, that you may become wholly a right Seed; that as touching your former Converſation, the old Man may be put off, and you may be wholly made conformable unto the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, that ſo you may live with him, and live to God through him; and that you may be redeemed from the vain Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the World, and faſhioned (according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Power) like unto the Son of God: That as you have born the Image of the Earthly, and been made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto the Faſhions and Cuſtoms of this preſent ſinful World; ſo henceforth you may bear the Image of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and be made conformable or ſubject unto the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or operation of the Heavenly Divine Power of God, with which he hath reached unto you, and viſited you, that in all things our Lord Chriſt may be your example, who made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no Reputation, but humbled himſelf, and became o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, and is ſate down at the Right-hand of the Majeſty on High, making interceſſion for them that come unto God by him; and ſo is become the Authour of eternal Salvation unto all them that believe and obey him, that he in all things may have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence. And ſo, my dear Friends, as I ſaid unto you, let him be your example to walk by, of whoſe Spirit you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a meaſure, to be a Guide, Rule, and Counſellour unto you, and none vary from the leadings thereof in any wiſe, nor by any means, for then you wander, or go into darkneſs, and ſo loſe your way of peace, and then trouble will come in upon you, and deſperation will be ready to get up in your minds; or contrariwiſe a ſpirit of conceitedneſs, will carry away the mind into a motion or profeſſion of the Truth, out of the Life of it, and will lead thee to talk of former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, when thou haſt loſt the thing by and through which thou gaineſt that experience which thou once hadſt, and which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93507:59"/>
thou now talkſt of, and ſo thou wilt grow into a form and profeſſion of Truth, without the power and life of it, and this is not a Sacrifice acceptable or agreeable unto the mind of God, but contrariwiſe altogether diſagreeable unto his mind and holy Spirit, and his Soul hates it, and hath no pleaſure therein. Wherefore, my dear Friends, dwell and watch in the Light of the Son of God, unto which, from the darkneſs you have been turned, that therein every one may be kept in a true and clear ſence and diſcerning of his own preſent ſtate, and ſtanding, and there the Power of God is felt, which goes over that which would drive into unbelief or deſperation, in the time of trouble. And this ſame Power or God will alſo keep down the aſpiring mind, that would be exalted above the Croſs, and would intrude into things which is not revealed of God, and would be puft up therewith, and glory therein, all ſuch glorying is vain. And this is the Enemy that would not have Chriſt to reign over him, neither will it be ſubject to the higher Power, but will deſpiſe the Authority of God, and ſpeak evil of Dignities. And this muſt be ſlain; for this ſpirit hath not the mind of Chriſt, neither would walk as Chriſt did, nor have him for its example, but would be of reputation in the World, and ſeeks the praiſe of men, and the honour of men, and not the honour that comes from God only; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretence or ſhew of humility this ſpirit comes under, yet it ſeeks it ſelf, and its own reputation, and will admire mens perſons for its advantage, and will juſtifie the wicked for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (or for its advantage, or to ſet up and exalt it ſelf, and will cry peace to the wicked and ungodly, and preach judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the righteous. And this is the temper of that unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, exalted, ſelf-ſeeking ſpirit, where, or in whomſoever it gets an entrance, as hath been largely made manifeſt, and as by woful experience we have ſeen. Wherefore beware of that ſpirit, and receive it not, but deny it, for it is not of God, but ſhall fall and wither, and come to nought, the Lord hath ſpoken it. Wherefore dwell every one in true ſubjection to the Croſs, and ſee that your joy and rejoycing be in that, for therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is your ſafety, and there you learn of Chriſt, and have,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93507:60"/>
and feel) the teachings of his good Spirit, and this keeps in the true humility which goeth before the true honour, and in this you are ſenſible of the proſperity, or going on of the Work of God in you; and here you will know a daily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſtrength and power of the wicked one, whoſe work is to lead or drive out of the ſtraight, pure, and holy way (into which God hath brought you) which leads unto life, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting you from this, he then leads or drives into exaltation, or deſperation, both which leads to the chambers of death; But as you all wait in the true ſimplicity, and in obedience to the Word of Gods Power in your own hearts, you will be kept clear in your underſtandings; for as ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>He that heareth the Word of God, and doth it not, is like unto a man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his natural face in a glaſs, and ſtraightway goeth his way and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth what manner of man he was.</hi> But be not you forgetful Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but Doers of the Word, and let it dwell plentifully in you, ſo will you be kept ſenſible of your ſtate and condition; but if you go from that, then you loſe your fence and underandſting that you had before of the manner of your ſtate and then deadneſs will grow, and careleſneſs and negligence, and thou wilt become dry and barren, and unfruitful; and ſo my dear hearts having large experience, and being largely ſenſible of the many wiles, ſubtilties, and craftineſſes of the wicked one, I cannot do leſs (for the love ſake which I bear in my heart towards you) then to lay theſe things before you, and to re-mind you of them, although you have been told of them before yet as the Apoſtle ſaid, I think it meet, (yea, and it is my duty ſo to do) while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this Tabernacle, to re-mind you of theſe things; and according to the working of the Power of God, and Word of life, to ſtirre you up to watchfulneſs, diligence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, knowing that therein your preſervation and ſafety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth: So dwell and watch in the Light, and in the ſenſe and feeling of Gods eternal quickning Spirit of life, and in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and true ſubjection thereunto, and there all the ſnares of the wicked one will be diſcovered to thee, and a Way ſeen to eſcape them all, ſo that none will fall therein, but be kept by the Power of God, in the even, pure, ſtraight, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93507:60"/>
way, which is narrow and leads to life eternal; and herein is no exaltation nor deſperation, nor deadneſs, nor dulneſs of ſpirit, but a diligent and patient witing upon the Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Counſels and Inſtructions, in all ſtates, ſtraits, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als whatſoever, that may come upon thee for the tryal of thy Faith, which is much more pretious then that of gold which periſheth.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, be nothing terrified, nor yet diſmayed at the proſperity, rage, or fury of the wicked, for they have their day, and their conſolation here, and when that is over, (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid) they ſhall be cut off, for their feet are ſet in ſlippery places, and their Rock is not as our Rock, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be Judges, but wait you upon the Lord, for the manifeſtation of his will, and give up your ſelves to do or ſuffer whatſoever he calls you unto, and be you reſigned up, to be wholly diſpoſed of according to the ordering of his Hand of Love, or Arm of Power manifeſted in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Light, and follow the Lord Chriſt your Captain, whitherſoever he leads you, not loving your lives unto the death, and as valiant Souldiers endure hardſhips, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end, looking over and beyond all difficulties that may appear in your way; and keep your eye upon the mark that ſtands before, and then you will feel forcible drawings in your hearts by the Spirit of the Lord to preſs on towards it, and nothing will be accounted dear to part with for it, nor any thing grievous to be born or ſuffered, that in the end thou mayſt purchaſe it, but there will be courage and ſtrength ſufficient given thee of the Lord to bear all things, and endure all things, as thou reſign'ſt up thy ſelf unto him, and thou wilt have peace with God in thine own heart and conſcience, in all tryals, and in all tribulations; and in the end thou wilt have the full deſire of thy ſoul, and ſatisfaction to it; and ſo my love is dear to you all, who are Babes in Chriſt, and is largely extended to the whole flock of God in all Countreys, Regions and Quarters of the Earth: But for your ſakes have I chiefly written this Epiſtle, who are young in the Truth, and have not ſo full acquaintance with the workings of Satan, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93507:61"/>
ſo full a knowledge of the depths of the myſtery of iniquity as others have, who are of a more full age in the truth; and receive this as a Salutation of my dear love to you, and a manifeſtation of my tender care for you, and the Lord God Almighty give you wiſdom and underſtanding, and diſcerning, that you may chuſe the good, and refuſe the evil, and may follow after that above all things, which makes for your everlaſting peace and happineſs, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>WHat do you mean by theſe Practiſes? Or what do you expect to bring to paſs by theſe your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings and Proceedings? Do you think thereby to root out the Holy Seed, and Royal Off-ſpring of God, which he hath raiſed and brought forth in theſe North
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93507:62"/>
parts of the World to rule and reign (according to his promiſe made by the Mouths of his Prophets in Ages paſt) to which Nations muſt bow, and bend, and become Subject; I tell you plainly, and truly, that if this be your expectations (which your proceedings gives me cauſe to believe it is) you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fail therein; And God will aſſuredly fruſtrate theſe your expectations, and by this very way and means that you take to ſuppreſs and root out the People of God from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Beeing amongſt you; even thereby you will provoke the Lord to root out you, if you perſiſt therein: Wherefore beware, leſt that which you think (and expect) to bring upon the People of God, be by the hand of God brought upon your ſelves. For (be it known unto you) the Lord God Almighty is with his People of a truth, whom you have turned your Sword and Power againſt; and what is done unto them, he certainly taketh as done unto himſelf: And in as much as you go about to ſuppreſs his people, or to limit them in the exerciſe of their Conſciences towards God, you therein are found Figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt God, and thereby you go about to ſtop and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Work of God, which will be as hard for you to do, as it was for <hi>Saul</hi> to Kick againſt the Pricks of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in his own Conſcience. Wherefore conſider theſe things, and remember that many Warnings and tender Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations of Love, the Lord hath ſent unto you, in times paſt, (which you have little regarded hitherto, but go on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing Cruelty towards the people of God) And now at this time alſo I am moved (and it is upon my heart) by the Spirit of the Lord, to lay theſe things before you, and to tell you in plainneſs what the Lord will do and bring to paſs; in deſpite of all that you can do, who ſeek to oppoſe him; For notwithſtanding the many Laws and Decrees which you have made or ſhall make, yet the Work of the Lord which he hath certainly begun, that ſhall go on and increaſe, and the Truth muſt flouriſh and proſper, and ſpread forth it ſelf; and the Kingdoms of the World muſt become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, according to his Promiſe; and they that will not bow unto his Thorne and Government, who is KING of Kings, (whoſe right it is to rule in the Conſciences
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93507:62"/>
of people, and to bear the Government there, and to exerciſe them in matters of worſhip towards God,) but will ſeek to ſtop to limit him in his Government there, even ſuch muſt, and ſhall be broken by him, and bruiſed under by his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power; the Lord hath ſaid and ſpoken it, and it muſt come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Friends, be you once more warned, That you meddle no more with the Conſciences of people, ſo as to go about to limit them in matters relating to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God (for its not the place of a civil Magiſtrate to meddle or have to do with thoſe things) but leave them free in thoſe things to do as they are perſwaded in their own Conſciences by the Light of the Spirit of the Lord, for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give an account unto God for them, if they do amiſs, but they muſt all (and ſo muſt you alſo give an account unto God, every one for himſelf; and this is juſt and equal, that in (things of this nature) every one ſhould be left to the exerciſe of the Spirit of the Lord in his own heart, becauſe that Spiritual Worſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in obedience to the Spirit of God, and you your ſelves would not be willing to be prohibited from, or denyed of this liberty; but (I dare ſay) you would look upon it to be a very great Oppreſſion unto you to be reſtrained (by any civil Power or Government) from that, which by the Spirit and Power of God you were perſwaded in your Conſciences you ought to do; and you could not but judge that thoſe (who ſhould go about to lay or impoſe ſuch a reſtriction upon you) did do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as they themſelves would not be done by; and ſo you might well conclude that it were unrighteouſneſs in them ſo to do: Wherefore if you ſeriouſly conſider whether this unrighteouſneſs and Oppreſſion be not found in you; I know you cannot but lay your hands upon your mouths, and confeſs Guilty.</p>
                  <p>So let my Counſel be (at this time) received by you, and take my Advice (as from one that hath received the Counſel of the Lord, and (in Meaſure) knows the Mind of the Lord by the revelation of his Spirit as touching this matter) that is this; Shake your ſelves out of theſe cruel practiſes of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting about Religion and Worſhip and lay aſide theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93507:63"/>
cruel Impoſitions, which are and have been laid upon the People of God; by reaſon whereof, many (who are dear unto the Lord) have ſuffer'd very greatly; ſome the loſs of their Liberties, and ſome the loſs of their Lives, occaſion'd through being thruſt together in noiſom Holes and Priſons, and others are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to exilement from their Wives, and Children, and from their Native Country, and deareſt Relations; and no evil at all juſtly charged againſt any of theſe, for which theſe cruel Sufferings are inflicted upon them; 'tis only for Worſhipping God in Spirit, that theſe Sufferings are ſuſtain'd by them; that is the greateſt Charge that hath been by you at all prov'd againſt them: And for theſe things ſake the Lord's Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is certainly great with you, and while you continue in theſe things, through which you have provoked the Lord to Anger: His Wrath will not be appeaſed towards you, neither can your Government be eſtabliſht in Safety, nor you cannot eſtabliſh your ſelves in Safety and Security; for Fear will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize you (while you go on in theſe Practiſes) becauſe of the Guilt that is upon your Conſciences; and although we cannot, neither do we deſire to make outward oppoſition againſt you, by Plottings, and Inſurrections, &amp;c. (Out of which things God Almighty hath redeem'd us, and hath brought us into his Covenant of Peace, and unto his Mountain of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where nothing hurts nor deſtroys) Yet we know that the Lord is with us, and is on our ſide, and takes our part, and will plead our Cauſe, and Fight for us; and He is ſtronger then you all, and his Power is above yours, and our Truſt and Confidence is in him alone, and not in the Arm of Fleſh; and its in vain for you to ſtrive againſt him, or to oppoſe or reſiſt him; for he will in the end be too hard for you, and will break you to pieces, as a Potters Veſſel of Clay, except you Repent.</p>
                  <p>And now, Friends, there is but one only Way, by which you may, or can poſſibly eſcape and prevent the Dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, or by which his Anger may be appeas'd which is kindled againſt you; and that is this, To Humble your ſelves before the Lord, and to Repent of the Evil of your Doings, and to looſe the Bands of Iniquity, and to undo the heavy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93507:63"/>
burthens, and let the oppreſſed go free, and turn the ſword againſt the Evil-doers, and ſuppreſs vice and profaneneſs, and do not tollerate licenciouſneſs, and thoſe wicked practiſes (as rioting, and drunkenneſs, ſtage playes, and the like) which day by day even greatly abounds in your Streets, while the Servants of the Lord lie in noiſom Holes and Priſons; And give liberty of Conſcience unto the People of God to Worſhip him (which is the main thing that I contend with you for) that the Servants of the Lord may have free liberty to labour for the reducing of People from thoſe afore-mentioned, and all other vices, which tends to the deſtruction of youth, and to the deſtroying both of Soul and Body; and this is the way for you (if there be any) to purchaſe the good will and favour of God; and to be eſtabliſhed in ſafety and ſecurity in your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if any (who are ſelf-ſeekers and time-ſervers) ſhall (for ſelf-ends) counſel you otherwayes, ſuch (you ſhall know in the day of the Lord) are evil counſellors, and ought not to be received by you, but denied.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, one thing more I would preſent to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which hath been oft laid before you in times paſt, and as oft forgotten by you, that is this; What hath been the ground and original cauſe of all the late over-turnings, which hath been in this Nation? if it be rightly weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; will it not appear that cruelty and oppreſſion of mens Conſciences in matters relating to the Service of God, was the main original cauſe thereof? I confeſs I cannot but marvel you ſhould be ſo blinded (with your preſent proſperity) that you cannot ſee and conſider theſe things, and labour to avoid that which was the cauſe of their overthrow and ruine, that are gone before you, but to run on ſo head-long and inconſiderate, as though you were haſting with deſire to bring the wrath of God upon you: For mark, Friends, When did any eſcape the hand of God in any Age or Generation? or, Where were any eſtabliſhed in ſafety that took in hand this work of oppreſſion, and perſecuting the Seed of God and his People? conſider from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (that great oppreſſor) unto this day, and you will find that in all Ages, this work of perſecuting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the People of God, was the very cauſe of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93507:64"/>
and ruine of the Perſecutors; as for inſtance, The great perſecution and cruelty that was exerciſed by the then Powers of the Nation in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes; What was the iſſue thereof? was it not the very overthrow, and rooting out of that perſecuting Power, and Religion, and Faith, &amp;c? And do not their names (who exerciſed that cruelty) remain as an ill ſavour unto all ſober People (truly fearing God) unto this day? And could they by all their tyranny then exerciſed, root out or extinguiſh that Faith and Religion, that they then ſtruck at? Nay, they could not, though it was but (as I may ſay) the beginning of Reformation, and coming out of the Apoſtacy; but its true indeed, they killed, deſtroyed, and murthered many; but bleſſed be the Lord that did not ſhake the reſt ſo as to make them fall, but rather eſtabliſh them. And certainly, Friends, although you ſhould be permitted (as they were) to deſtroy many of us by your Laws, and Decrees, made or to be made, yet you cannot thereby deſtroy the faith of others, neither can you poſſibly accompliſh your deſire, nor root out the holy Seed, which is now ſprung and riſen, and muſt repleniſh Nations, and cauſe the deſolate places to be inhabited; though indeed you may thereby root out and deſtroy your ſelves, which is ſad to conſider.</p>
                  <p>So Friends, much more might be ſaid unto you, and many ſound reaſons and arguments might be produced to convince you how unſafe it is for you, to perſevere in this Work of perſecution and cruelty; but I know you will (many of you, if not moſt of you) kick againſt it, and harden your hearts, and will not believe; wherefore I have choſen rather to be as brief as may be, only to diſcharge my conſcience unto you in the ſight of the Lord, that I may be clear of your blood, and ſo ſhall conclude even with a few words; telling you, That this work which you have begun, and put your hands unto, will be too hard for you, for when did ever any yet riſe up againſt the Lord and proſper? or do you think to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the Ancient of dayes, although your Predeceſſors could not; Oh nay, it cannot be: But then you will ſay that it is not the Work of God that you oppoſe, but Hereſie and Sedition, &amp;c. I anſwer, ſo ſaid your Predeceſſors the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93507:64"/>
in all Generations, when they ſlew the Prophets, and Crucified the Son of God, and perſecuted the Apoſtles; they charged them with Blaſphemy and Sedition, and Turners of the World up-ſide down; and ſaid, The Earth was not able to bear them, &amp;c. Yet that would not be a ſufficient excuſe for them, in the day when God took vengance; neither will it be a ſufficient excuſe for you in the day when you muſt (all without reſpect of perſons) give an account unto God for all your deeds done in the body, wherefore beware leaſt that come upon you which was ſpoken by the Prophet of old, ſaying, <hi>Behold ye Deſpiſers and wonder, and periſh; for I work a work in your dayes, which you can in no wiſe believe, though a man declare it unto you.</hi>

                  <p>OH <hi>England, England,</hi> the Land of my Nativity, who art full of Abominations, and whoſe ſin hath reached Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, how art thou filled with pride and oppreſſion, perſecutions and cruelty, and all kinds of Abomination abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thee; How hath the cry of the oppreſſed been heard in thy ſtreets, and ſtill is, and yet thoſe who are in power to relieve them, have turned away their ears, and have had no regard thereunto, but have feignedly made many fair Promiſes (in times paſt) of freedom, and liberty from thoſe oppreſſive, Antichriſtian yoaks and burdens that have long been laid upon the tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Gods people: But alas, they have had little regard to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93507:65"/>
their engagements, but have hitherto dealt deceitfully and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly with the Lord and his People, and the bonds of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are ſtill ſtanding; and inſtead of breaking of them (according to the requirings of the Lord, and their own engagements) they have made them more ſtronge, and thereby added afflictions unto the ſufferings of Gods people; and by theſe things is the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, for he hath ſeen it, and it diſpleaſeth him: And therefore, is his controverſie great with thee, Oh <hi>England,</hi> and his hand is ſtretched out in Judgment againſt thee O Land of my Nativity; becauſe of which my heart is even afflicted within me, for the ſake of thy Inhabitants, and I am even preſſed in ſpirit to declare unto thee thy Abominations, and wherein thy Sin lyeth, that hath thus provoked the Lord, that if happily thoſe (within thy Borders) who have not quite ſinned out their Day, may hear, and fear, and repent, and find Mercy at the Hand of the Lord, that their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility may be lengthened; for he is a God of tender compaſſion, and wills not the death nor deſtruction of any; and therefore, hath his hand been long ſtretched forth in mercy and love unto thee, and his ſpirit hath long ſtrived with thee to have gathered thee, and he ſent his Prophets and Servants unto thee, even riſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early, and ſending them before the day of his Judgments broke forth, and they proclaimed (in thy ſtreets) Gods mighty day at hand; and forewarned thy Inhabitants both high and low, great and ſmall, bond and free, male and female, Rulers and people of the dreadful Day of Gods Judgments, which is now begun to be revealed; but they hearkned not, neither would they receive the councel of wiſdom that cryed in thy ſtreets, but deſpiſed all her reproofs; and although ſhe hath continued ſending her Prophets and wiſe men unto this day, yet hitherto they have not hearkned, nor regarded, but have gone on in pride, and preſumption, in perſecution and cruelty, and have nouriſhed their hearts as in a day of ſlaughter, and given up themſelves to follow pleaſures, and have walked in the luſts and devices of their own hearts, and (as much as in them lies) they have fulfilled the deſires of their own minds, and lived careleſly, and wantonly upon the earth, as though there was no God; therefore, is thy Judgments juſt from the Hand of the Lord, and thy reward is the recompence of thy own doings, for thy iniquities hath pulled his Judgments upon

thee, and thy ſins have brought his Plagues, and thou muſt confeſs that he is juſt in all his wayes, and righteous in all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>For conſider, Oh Nation, and let me expoſtulate the matter with thee a little; and then judge thy ſelf what reward thou art worthy of: What could the Lord have done for thee more then he hath done, (or hath he done ſo for another Nation, as for thee) he hath even filled thee with all manner of temporal bleſſings and benefits that the hearts of thy Inhabitants could deſire, Corn and Oyle, and Wine in abundance have been brought into thee, and all kind of Neceſſaries both for food and raiment hath he cauſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in thee, that thy Inhabitants might be fed and cloathed, and that want might not be unto any within thy Borders; and alſo, that thou mightſt therein be a bleſſing unto other Nations about thee: but alas, how haſt thou abuſed his Mercies, even in theſe Temporal things, and converted them unto another uſe, then that for which they were ordained and given unto thee! How have many of thy Inhabitants ſpent much of their time to invent what to be cloathed with, and after what manner to be arrayed, in all kind of gorgeous Apparel! when others with all their care and induſtry could ſcarce get Raiment to put on to cover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but have been even ready to ſtarve for want: And how have many been inventing what to eat, and drink, &amp; alſo making waſte and havock of Gods good Creatures, while many aged, poor and feeble have been in want of bread to eat, and in neceſſity of food convenient for the preſervation of the natural health; and in this their diſtreſſed ſtate and condition they have not had compaſſion on them, nor commiſerated their ſtate; but even vaunted over them, as though they had not been their fellow Creatures, and as though God had not appointed them to pertake of the fruits of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in theſe things the Mercies of God have been abuſed, and his Creatures have been converted to a wrong uſe, and the Lords Love and Goodneſs therein hath been very evilly requited by Thee, and will it not be very juſt, if the Lord ſends want and ſcarcity, and famine inſtead of this great plenty, amongſt thoſe who have thus evilly requited the Lord in abuſing his Mercies? Yes verily. For conſider:</p>
                  <p>Do not the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> abound in thee, by which God was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93507:66"/>
provoked to conſume it; yea, and greater ſins then were charged upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> which was <hi>Pride, Fulneſs of Bread,</hi> and <hi>Aboundance</hi> of <hi>Idleneſs:</hi> But, Oh Nation! thou haſt not been only found in theſe Sins (and yet they have abounded in thee alſo, as God's faithful Witneſs in the Hearts of thy Inhabitants will teſtifie) but over and above all this, many of thy Inhabitants (even thoſe who ought to be Examples of Chaſtity to others) have given up themſelves to Whoredoms, and took delight therein, as though it were a thing not forbidden, but allow'd of God; but unto many of them it is happen'd (and doubtleſs it will unto more) according unto that ſaying, <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> Well,</p>
                  <p>But this is not all that I have to charge this Nation guilty of; for, How do Oaths cauſe this Land to Mourn, even near unto Deſolation? And how are the hearts of many of the Inhabitants thereof harden'd, and even ſear'd as with a Hot Iron; ſo that without any ſenſe of the Reproofs of God's Witneſs in them, they blaſpheme the pure and worthy Name of the Holy Lord God, by Curſing, Swearing, Ranting, and Sporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the day time in all kind of Paſtimes, as though they endeavoured with all their Force and Might, to draw one another, as much as in them lie out of the Fear of God? And beſide all this, What Lying and Diſſembling is there amongſt thy Inhabitants, notwithſtanding all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of (a Reformed) Chriſtian Religion; yet what couſening, cheating, and defrauding one another is there within thy borders? and ſo treacherous have thy Inhabitants bin one towards another, and ſuch rotten heartedneſs, and double dealing have they ſound one in another, that few of them dare truſt one another.</p>
                  <p>Again, O how doth drunkenneſs alſo abound in thee, oh <hi>England?</hi> and how are many Houſes filled even night and day with riotous perſons, ſpending and waſting the Creation upon their ungodly luſts, and aſſembling themſelves together, even great multitudes to their invented Stage-Playes, and all kind of Vanities, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, when the people of the Lord, who fear his Name, are not ſuffered to meet peaceably together to wait upon God, and to worſhip him, but they muſt be thruſt into Priſons, or beat and abuſed, and knockt down, and by theſe things hath the Lord been
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93507:67"/>
provoked to viſit thee with theſe his juſt, and ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Oh <hi>England, England,</hi> what Lamentation ſhall I take up for thee, for whom the Lord hath done ſo great things, not only in giving of thee ſuch fulneſs of temporal bleſſings, and benefits (for the end before expreſſed, which thou haſt abuſed, as herein is ſignified) But over and above all this, he manifeſted his Eternal Power in the midſt of thee, and thereby wrought Miraculouſly in the hearts of a Remnant of thy Inhabitants, to whom he made known the Myſterious Way (which the Vulterous eye never ſaw) which leads to Life, and Salvation (and whom he made choice of, to be a kind of firſt fruits unto himſelf in theſe latter dayes) and whom he ſeparated from the aforeſaid abominations, (in which thou art yet involv'd) and raiſed them up to be examples of Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs, and Godlineſs of Converſation; and to bear Teſtimony (and cry) againſt thy unrighteous and ungodly Wayes, and alſo put into their hearts (by his Spirit) to tell of his Power which he had Revealed in them, and to proclaim his mighty Day at hand, in which he would Judge the Inhabitants of the Land in Righteouſneſs; and alſo he warned us, to warn thy Inhabitants to Repent, and we cryed aloud in thy Streets, in thy Steeple houſes, and in thy Markets, as thy Inhabitants well know; and we told them of the dreadfull Day of Gods Judgments at hand, to come upon all who (lived, and) continued in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, abominations; that ſo they might have returned to the Lord, and have come to walk in the light of his Son, wherewith they were enlightned, that ſo thereby they might have been led out of the aforeſaid abominations, and Works of Darkneſs, and ſo have eſcaped the Judgments threatned.</p>
                  <p>But inſtead of harkning to the voice of Wiſdom which cry'd in the Streets, thy Inhabitants rejected her counſel, and deſpiſed all her reproofs; and deſpitefully uſed the Meſſengers of the Lord, whom he ſent unto thee, and caſt them into Holes and Priſons, in which they have outwardly periſhed, whoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood yet lies at thy Doors; which God will certainly take vengeance for.</p>
                  <p>And ſo far haſt thou been, O <hi>England,</hi> from taking Warning or Example by thoſe whom God thus raiſed up within thy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93507:67"/>
Borders, and ſent to Warn thee; that even thy Rulers (with the advice and counſel of thy Chief Prieſts, and Prophets) have made divers Laws, and Decrees, by which they have endeavour'd to ſtop and limit this Work of the Almighty, which by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power he has begun in the hearts of his Remnant, which he hath raiſed up to be a peculier People unto himſelf within thy Borders.</p>
                  <p>And as though all thy afore-ſaid Abominations were too little, and that thou mightſt yet add thereunto; how have thy Rulers abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Power which God committed to them, and intruſted them withall, in tolerating all thoſe Licencious Practiſes, which daily have abounded in thy Streets; and in ſuffering the Wicked, and Evil-doers to go unpuniſhed, and in turning their Sword againſt the Innocent, and to Perſecute the harmleſs People of the Lord, for the exerciſe of their pure Conſciences towards him in matters relating to his Worſhip; and in taking upon them to Lord over the Conſciences of men, the Seat of God: have they not herein greatly abuſed the Power committed to them, and intruded into the Prerogative of God? Oh great Preſumption, and Uſurpation indeed, a Sin which ſhall not go unpuniſhed by the Judge — But, Oh that they had hearkned, and taken Warning in time, that ſo they might have been Healed! but now it will go hard with many of them; for God will certainly be Avenged, for this thing; For is it not Juſtice in him to Diſ-throne ſuch, who would thruſt themſelves into his Throne, and ſo Preſumptiouſly to entrench upon his Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>Again conſider, How many and great have the Sufferings been, that have been ſuſtained by us (whom God raiſed up) (in the midſt of thee, Oh <hi>England</hi>) to bear Teſtimony unto his Name, and againſt thy Traditional Worſhips, and dead Forms, and out-ſide Profeſſions, with the reſt of thy Abominations) even by reaſon of the Laws, and Decrees which thy Rulers have made againſt us, and ſometimes without them alſo? and how oft have we been thruſt together into noiſome Priſons, and have ſuffered all kind of abuſes, as Socking, Stoning, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, knocking down, ſome Killed, in the Streets, and Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſes, and in our Peaceable Meetings, where we were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered only to Worſhip God in Spirit? and thus evilly haſt

thou requited the Lord and his People, for his and their love, and good will unto thee, that thou haſt accounted them not worthy to have a being within thy Borders; but in thy Decrees made againſt them, thou haſt deſigned their Exilement, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation, from amongſt thine Inhabitants, although according to the Law of God, and Nature, (we, and) thoſe whom thy Rulers have already Baniſhed (and expoſed to the hardſhips, and difficulties which the Seas, and forraign Countrys affords) have as juſt a right as themſelves, here to have continued in the Land of our Nativity, and to have enjoyed the Liberty of their Conſciences in the Service and Worſhip of God, together with all other Temporal benefits, and comforts which God had afforded unto them, as Wives, Children, and Eſtates, &amp;c.

                  <p>Well, but, all this is but as a hint of what might be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of the Abominations that is found in thee, Oh <hi>England;</hi> yet hereby thou mayeſt perceive whether or no thy Sins doth not exceed the Sins of <hi>Sodom?</hi> (whom God Deſtroyed in his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) and whether thy Iniquities doth not ſurmount the Iniquities of <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> Certainly, if Gods Witneſs may ariſe and Anſwer me in the Conſciences of thy Inhabitants, it will make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they do; and what then canſt thou expect from the hand of the Lord as a juſt reward of all theſe thy Abominations? ſurely thou canſt not miſs of all the Judgments that have been pronounced by the Spirit of the Lord through his Servants, in thy Streets, Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſes, and Markets, and to thy Rulers both by Word, and Writing; for they muſt, and will unavoidably come upon thee, and then thou ſhalt know that the Lord ſpoke by his Servants, whom thou ſlightedſt, and that the moſt high Rules in the Kingdoms of men, and will execute Juſtice, and Judgment, and Righteouſneſs in the Earth, and then alſo thou ſhalt know, and confeſs that God

gave thee time to Repent, and to put away the evil of thy doings from before him, and fore-warned thy Rulers, alſo oft-times of the evil to come, and that they ſhould ſet free the Oppreſſed, and break the heavy Yoak of Perſecution from off the Necks of God's People, that with freedom and cheerfulneſs, they might ſerve him; but they have not hearkned thereunto, nor regarded at all; therefore is thy Plagues come, and thy Judgment have not lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, as is ſeen at this day.</p>
                  <p>But well, much of this kind have ofttimes been preſented to thy view and conſideration, ſo that I could even almoſt deſpair of hopes that thou wilt hear, or lend an Ear unto what I ſay at this time, becauſe I experimentally know that thou art a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nation againſt the Lord; yet my Bowels ſo yearns towards thoſe of thine Inhabitants, who have not quite ſinn'd out their Day; that I cannot but ſtrive with them a little, in repreſenting theſe things to their conſideration; that ſuch who have any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs left in them, may Repent with ſpeed, and turn to the Lord with all their hearts, not feignedly, but in ſincerity, that ſo they may find a hiding place in him from the Wrath to come and that they may underſtand the Cauſe wherefore the Lords Hand is ſtretched out againſt thee in Judgment, Oh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſurely all who are prudent in ſpirit, cannot but confeſs, and acknowledge that theſe things before mentioned, is the very cauſe of the preſent Viſitation that is upon thee, and alſo of the future Judgments which are threatned, for theſe are but the beginning of thy ſorrows which it to come upon thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou Repented not of thy Evil Deeds. Well.</p>
                  <p>But ſome it may be will ſay, what, and where hath been the cauſe that all theſe Abominations hath thus abounded, and been continued in thee, ſeeing thou haſt had ſuch a large Profeſſion of a reformed Chriſtian Religion? to whom I ſay, Search and examine, whether or no, the main ground and cauſe is not found in thy Teachers, and Leaders? for have they not cauſed thee to Err? and have they not ſtrengthned the hand of the worker of Iniquity (ſo that none can turn from the Evil of his Way) by promiſing of him life? and may not I ſay of thy Teachers, Oh <hi>England,</hi> as the Prophet of the Lord ſaid (of the falſe Prophets) in his day, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Prophets of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is Prophaneneſs gone forth into
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93507:69"/>
all the Earth; for hath not they Leaders been evil examples unto thee of prophaneneſs, of drunkenneſs, and whoredoms many of them, and univerſally of covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry? for moſt, or all, muſt needs ſee that their hearts are gone after cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous practiſes, and by their Lyes, (againſt the people of God) and by their lightneſs, they have cauſed the People to err from the right way, and have led them into rebellion againſt the Light of the Son of God, wherewith they are enlightned, (which would have led them out of the dark pathes of ignorance, and works of Iniquity) under pretence that it was a dangerous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be adhered unto, and that it was not ſufficient to lead out of ſin; nor to ſave from ſin, when indeed, there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name given under Heaven, whereby Men can be ſaved from ſin, but the name of Jeſus, who preached himſelf the Light of the World, and who lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, and whoſe free grace that bringeth ſalvation hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all men; ſo that all who turn from this Grace of God which teacheth us to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent evil World, ſuch turn from the right way, and all who rebell againſt this Light wherewith they are enlightned, they know not the way thereof, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, and ſo they are ſtrangers to the good and right way, which is Chriſt, who lighteth every Man that cometh into the World; and is not this Light or Spirit of Grace in the inward parts, the very thing that thy Leaders hath long perſwaded thee againſt, that thou ſhouldeſt not encline or adhere thereunto, under pretence as aforeſaid? and ſo are like unto them whom Chriſt ſaid, did ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men, who would neither enter in themſelves, and them that would enter they hindered; and although they have in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence made large Prayers againſt ſin, and iniquity, and ſeemed to preach againſt it likewiſe, yet they have indeed told thee thou couldſt not be waſhed, or freed from ſin, while here on Earth, and ſo have denyed the very work of the Miniſtry, which was for the perfecting of the Saints; for the Apoſtle laboured that he might preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt: and have they not hereby ſtrengthened the hands of the Workers of iniquity, even by begetting a belief in them that they cannot turn from the evil of their wayes, ſo as to be ſet free from their evil deeds, and yet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93507:69"/>
they promiſe them life hereafter? but be not deceived with good words, and fair ſpeeches; for God will not be mocked with an out-ſide profeſſion, <hi>for if you live after the fleſh, you ſhall dye;</hi> for the wages of ſin is death, but the Gift of the Spirit of God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, through Chriſt our Lord, unto all them that receive and obey it.</p>
                  <p>Again, have not thy Leaders been the great Stirrers up of thy Rulers to perſecute the harmleſs People of the Lord, whom he hath raiſed up by his power to truſt in his Name, and to bear witneſs for him, and to teſtifie againſt thy abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? — have they not moved thy Rulers, and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to make Laws, and to put them in execution, as aforeſaid, againſt us? Conſider this, Oh Nation; what a blood-thirſty Generation of covetous Hirelings thou haſt nouriſhed within thy bowels? may I not ſay of them, as <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaid of the Prieſts in his dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> As Troopes of Robers wait for a Man, ſo the Company of Prieſts murder in the way by conſent? for have they not been even unanimous in this work of Perſecution? how many have they murdered (in the way (of <hi>Cain,</hi>) which they are in) by conſent; in caſting of them into Priſons for their filthy lukers ſake? and how have they provoked, and ſtirred up thy Rulers and people to the ſame work, and even made them their vaſſals to fulfill their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious wills?</p>
                  <p>So that all theſe things being conſidered (with many more, which might be mentioned) have we not juſt cauſe to attribute the main ground of thy continuing in theſe ſo groſs abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unto theſe covetous Hirelings, and filthy Dreamers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the fleſh? I confeſs, I cannot but believe, that there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of thouſands within thy Borders, <hi>Oh England,</hi> that ſee their folly and madneſs, and their unſtableneſs; and how they toſs up and down, and are driven about with every tempeſt that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, even as Clouds without rain, as their Predeceſſors were, whom the Apoſtle ſpoke of; and ſaw come in his day, who went in <hi>Cain</hi>'s way of Perſecution and Murder, and were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Stars, for whom was reſerved the blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever.</p>
                  <p>For have not the unſtabillity of theſe men, their wandering and toſſings to and fro (with every Wind or Tempeſt that hath ariſed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93507:70"/>
in this Nation) been evidently enough ſeen, in this our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; yea ſurely, all who are not wilfully blind cannot but perceive how not long ſince they preached up the Common-Prayer-Book, ſeemingly with a great zeal, as though Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not to be attained without Conformity thereunto; but no ſooner did the windy tempeſt ariſe which blew that away, and the then Powers of the Nation by whom it was upheld (and which theſe men ſwore for, and prayed for, &amp;c) came to be ſubdued, and the Church Faith, and Directory come to be ſet up in its ſtead, but preſently they were turned, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about with the tempeſt, and wandered from the Comnon-Prayer-Book, and ſwore againſt the King and Houſe of Lords, by whom it was upheld, and whom before they prayed and ſwore for, and began to ſwear for the Common-Wealth, and to preach up the Church Faith, and Directory, with as much ſeeming zeal as before they had done the other. And now again, ſince the tempeſt hath riſen, and the wind hath blown ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and their Church Faith (of which Chriſt was not the Author) and Directory hath faln thereby, and the Common-Prayer-Book again ſet up in its old place, they are perſently wandered back again to that, and driven about thither, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it up, and praying, and ſwearing for King, and houſe of Lords, whom they formerly preached, and prayed, and ſwore againſt, and theſe things they do with as impudent faces (many of them) as though they had never varied from it. Oh hypocritical, treacherous, deceitful hearted Generation, who ſhall believe them to be Meſſengers, or Miniſters of God, that have no more ſtability with them; truly their very actions in turning, and toſſing, and wandering to and fro, hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared them to be without any true foundation; and who ſhall conſide in them for the time to come that are ſo variable? have we not ground to believe that they will turn to the old Maſs, or to the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Alcharon, or any thing that the Powers of the Nation ſhall countenance? ſurely, they who believe better then ſo of them, will be deceived by many, or moſt of them, as many have been already in times paſt; for although they feignedly appear as ſuch who ſhould take care and watch for the Soul, yet we experimentally ſee, that they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93507:70"/>
ſeek for their own gain, and indeed they ſerve not the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt but their own bellies, for their fruits declare, that they will Murder (as they have done) many for their Bellies: And although they flatter with the King, and thy Rulers, Oh <hi>England,</hi> as though they ſought and ſtudy'd their Well-fare and Safety, and would counſel them for their Eſtabliſhment and Security; yet they are a treacherous Generation, and it is not ſafe for the King to truſt then; for they have an End unto themſelves in moſt, or all that they do, and their own Intereſt is concern'd in moſt of their Enterprizes; for they are Lovers of their own ſelves, and of Pleaſures more then of God (as the King and his Council may eaſily ſee, if they conſider it, and take an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into it: And let me tell the King and his Council this by the way, together with the reſt of thy Rulers (Oh <hi>England</hi>) That if they, hearken to the Counſel of theſe Self-ſeeking and Time ſerving-men, who are Wandring Stars, and Clouds driven with Tempeſts, as afore is declar'd; I ſay, if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe Blind Guides, and hearken to their Counſel, ſo as to be ſway'd by them, and become their Vaſſels, to fulfil their Blood-thirſty Deſires, in Proſecuting, Baniſhing, and making Havock of the People of God; then, in the end they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fall into the Ditch of Everlaſting Deſtruction and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Shame and Contempt, out of which there is no recovery, and then ſhall they know, that God hath ſpoken by me, and that a Prophet of the Lord hath been amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Oh Nation, and you Inhabitants thereof, let my Counſel be acceptable unto you at this time, that if poſſible ſo many of you, who have not quite ſinn'd out your Day (and have yet any Tenderneſs of Heart left in you towards God) may come to find a Hiding-place from the Wrath to come: For, if the aforeſaid crying Sins and Abominations (which your Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are a great Cauſe of, as afore-ſhew'd) are continu'd in, then utter Deſtruction and Deſolation, muſt, and will unavoidably come upon you. Wherefore hearken not to them who tell you that you cannot be made free from Sin, while you remain in this Body; but hearken to the Voice of God, who is Light, and who ſearcheth your Hearts, and declareth the Secrets thereof
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93507:71"/>
unto you, by his Faithful and True Witneſs, which he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in your Conſciences, and which calls out of Sin and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; for, if you are in the Light, and walk in the Light, wherewith you are enlightened, the Blood of Jeſus, Chriſt, will clenſe you from all Sin, and Waſh you from all Iniquity, as the Apoſtle teſtified. Neither lend an Ear to them, who ſtir you up to Perſecute the Innocent for the exerciſe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences towards God in his Worſhip; for they cauſe you to Err, and to Tranſgreſs the Royal Law of God (which ſaith, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do ye unto them) and thereby you will purchaſe the diſpleaſure of the Lord againſt your ſelves, as many have already done, which will not eaſily be appeaſed: Wherefore ſave your ſelves from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Generation of falſe Prophets, who cauſe you to Err, and who make a prey upon you; and Come out from amongſt them, and be ſeperate from them, and Touch not the unclean thing, or any thing whatſoever that will defile the Conſcience; but break off your Sins, and all kind of Iniquities by ſpeedy Repentance, and by true ſubmiſſion to Gods faithfull Witneſs, his Spirit of Grace in your inward parts, which will Teach you (as it did the Saints of Old, and as it doth us) that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, you ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World; for there is not another way to eſcape the Righteous and Dreadful Judgments of the Lord, which are already begun to be Revealed upon thy Inhabitants, Oh <hi>England,</hi> but only by turning to the Lord with their whole hearts, and by truly humbling themſelves before him, and by learning obedience to the Gift of his Spirit, which hath long ſtrived with them: for it is not an out-ſide Profeſſion, that will ſerve turn; the Lord hath been long grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therewith already, and many have ſoared aloft, above the Meaſure of the Gift of the Spirit of God, into an airy Profeſſion of high things, but have not had the Life of what they have Profeſſed, only have made their Profeſſion a Cloak for their Wickedneſs, many of them; and thereby the Spirit of the Lord is and hath been grieved; and he is now ariſen to lay open their Madneſs, that their Shame may appear, of which he ſent them a Sign before-hand; and now all falſe Foundations ſhall be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93507:71"/>
and all falſe coverings ſhall be ript of, and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Profeſſions ſhall wither; for God is Riſen to Fan the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to Winnow them, and he will ſeparate betwixt the Wheat, and the Chaff, and he will gather the Wheat into his Gardner, and the Chaff ſhall be burnt with unquenchable fire; and wo be unto them that are covered, and not with the covering of the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let every one humble themſelves under the hand of God which is now ſtretched out in Judgment, and mind the ſimplicity that was in Chriſt Jeſus, who made himſelf of no reputation, but humbled himſelf; and then will the lofty aſpiring mind be kept down, which otherwiſe will be aſpiring after (and intrudeing into) things above its reach, and will neglect to be obedient to thoſe ſmall things which are made known, and this hath been and ſtill is the ſtate of the greateſt part of people profeſſing Chriſtianity: But as I ſaid before, that will not ſerve their turn, nor give people acceptance with the Lord; for then had God been highly pleaſed with this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but contrary wiſe it hath provoked him to wrath, and to viſit them with his judgment, that thereby they may be humbled, whereby they may perceive that humiliation in life, and godlineſs of Converſation, and a righteous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right walking with the Lord, is of greater acceptation with the Lord then all outſide ſhews and empty profeſſions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>Therefore at laſt, amendment of life is the matter, and a cloſe walking with the Lord in his Covenant of Light, according to the appearance thereof, is the thing that muſt bring people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour and peace, and acceptance with the Lord; for this I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, neither will he regard them becauſe of their profeſſion, nor yet becauſe of their greatneſs, (for of him are all things) <hi>but in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs is accepted of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is it your many Prayers that he hath regard unto, while rebellion againſt his Spirit, with envy and murder againſt his people lodgeth in your hearts; and thoſe acts of violence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93507:72"/>
them are in your hand; for ſaith he, <hi>When you make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prayers I will not hear, for your hands are full of Blood:</hi> No more will your faſtings at all remove the preſent Viſitation, of his Judgments from amongſt you; nor cauſe Health to ſpring unto you, while you Faſt as you do at this day, that is (as your Fruits declare) for Strife, and Debate, and to Smite (the People of God) with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs, which is the Faſt that was forbidden of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58, 4. in which you do (according to your confeſſion) the things that you ought not to do, and you likewiſe leave undone (as you ſay) the things that you ought to do, that is to keep the Faſt which the Lord hath choſen; which is, to looſe the Bonds of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and to undo the heavy Burdens, (that is laid upon Gods People, and upon the Seed of God in your ſelves) and to let the Oppreſſed go free from thoſe Sufferings, that you inflict upon them, and that you break every Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Yoak; for this is the Faſt that you ought to keep, and theſe are things that you ought to do, (in order to the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the preſent hand of Judgment, which is ſtretched forth) which indeed you leave undone; and therefore (as you ſay) you have no health in you; but if you would keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, that is not to Faſt as you do this day, which is to Smite with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs; but if you would ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be quiet, and as much as in you lies to have Peace with all Men, and would keep the Faſt which the Lord hath choſen, that is to looſe the Bonds of Wickedneſs, and to undo the heavy Burdens, and ſet the Oppreſſed free, and wouldſt deal thy Bread to the hungry, and bring the Poor that are caſt out into thy Houſe; and when thou ſeeſt the Naked, that thou cloath them; and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh: then would the Promiſe of God (which he is not ſlack concerning) be ſoon fulfilled unto thee, Oh Nation; for then ſhould thy light break forth as the Morning, and thine health ſhould ſpring forth ſpeedily; thy Righteouſneſs ſhould go before thee, and the Glory of the Lord ſhould be thy Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; then thou ſhouldeſt call, and the Lord would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; thou ſhould'ſt cry, and he would ſay, here am I; for he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93507:72"/>
is faithful that Promiſed, and theſe are his faithful, and true Promiſes, which is not fulfilled unto thee, Oh Nation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou doeſt thoſe things, (as aforeſaid) which thou ought not to do, and leaves undone thoſe things which thou ought to do; and this is the cauſe that thine health doth not ſpring forth, and that thine Inhabitants, have no health in them.</p>
                  <p>Oh, <hi>England, England,</hi> How incurable is thy Wound? muſt many of thy mighty Men periſh or fall (before thy breach can be made up) through hearkning to the voice of an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs, whoſe feet abides not in her houſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.11. and through taking counſel of a whoriſh Woman, who hath corrupted the Earth with the abundance of her Fornications, and Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Bewitched the Inhabitants thereof with her Sorceries, and by whom many mighty Men have already fallen, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.26? Well, but muſt ſhe be the cauſe of the fall of many in this our day alſo? Oh, my heart is even brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en within, and I am even very ſorely afflicted, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe things. What, will not thy great Men, and Rulers hearken to the Counſel of the Lord? that they may be healed, but hearken to the voice of a Harlot, whoſe wayes are ſo moveable, that they cannot be known, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.6. and who cauſeth all to Periſh, that ſhe compaſſeth within her Habitation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.19? Well, I could wiſh, that if it were the Will of the Lord; it might not happen unto them, as it did unto <hi>Ahab</hi> of Old, who had provoked the Lord, (and by the falſe Accuſation of the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> cauſed the Blood of Innocent <hi>Naboth</hi> to be ſhed) until his Decree was ſealed againſt him, which cauſed him to ſay; Who ſhall perſwade <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he may go up, and fall at <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20. and there came forth a ſpirit, and ſtood before the Lord; and ſaid, I will perſwade him, and the Lord ſaid unto him, Wherewith? and he ſaid, I will go forth, and be a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit in the mouthes of all his Prophets; and the Lord ſaid, Thou ſhalt perſwade him, and prevail alſo; go forth, and do ſo: So the lying ſpirit, went in the mouthes of his Prophets, and perſwaded him by them, to go on in the thing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93507:73"/>
that he deſired; But <hi>Micaiah,</hi> the true Prophet of the Lord, told the King in faithfulneſs, what would be the iſſue of that Interprize, that he was puting himſelf upon; nevertheleſs, the King would not hearken unto <hi>Micaiah,</hi> but commanded that he ſhould be put in Priſon, and fed with the Bread of affliction, and with the Water of affliction, &amp;c. and hearkned unto the lying ſpirit, that was in the mouthes of his many Prophets, who propheſied ſmooth things unto him, and by them this lying ſpirit prevailed, and cauſed him to fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hoſt of the King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, I ſay, I could heartily wiſh that it may not be ſo with thy Rulers and Magiſtrates, (Oh <hi>Nation,</hi> as it was with <hi>Ahab</hi>) and that they have not ſo far provoked the Lord (by Perſecuting, and ſheding the Blood of the Innocent) as to cauſe him to ſeal his Decree, againſt them, or any of them, as he did againſt <hi>Ahab;</hi> and I could wiſh that it might not prove ſo (which I have cauſe to believe it will) that he hath given permiſſion to the lying ſpirit, to go in the mouthes of thy Prieſts, and Prophets, to perſwade thy Rulers, to go on in this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Work of Perſecuting the Innocent, and harmleſs People of the Lord, thereby to fill up the meaſure of their Fathers Iniquities; that ſo he may be avenged on them. But, Oh that thy Rulers had hearkned unto the Counſel of thoſe whom God ſent unto them; who came not for filthy Lucre, nor with flattering Speeches, but in the Name of the Lord, declaring his Counſel in plainneſs, and faithfulneſs for thy good; but Alas, inſtead of hearing their Counſel, they have done unto them as <hi>Ahab</hi> did unto <hi>Micaiah,</hi> even put them in Priſon, and fed them with the Bread, and Water of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and thereby they have provoked the Lord of Hoſts: So that without all controverſie (as I ſaid before) if thy Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers perſiſt, and go on following the Counſel of thoſe falſe Prophets, into whoſe mouthes the lying ſpirit is entred, to perſwade them that the way to remove, or ſtop the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Viſitation of Gods Judgments (which is Revealed in the midſt of thee) is to be ſevere in Perſecuting, and Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſpiſed and harmleſs People out of thy Borders:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93507:73"/>
I ſay, if their counſel be hearkned unto, and obeyed therein, that lying ſpirit will certainly thereby prevail, and will cauſe them to fall, and none ſhall help them; and they ſhall be broken with a perpetual breath, and none ſhall bind them up.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore hearken unto this ye Heads, and Rulers of the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> the Land of my Nativity; be not Proud, nor ſtout hearted againſt the Lord; but fear and dread the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of Heaven and Earth; for he hath certainly a Controverſie with you, and he will not at all regard the lofty looks, nor your proud Carriage, for he will be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced; wherefore humble your ſelves in Duſt and Aſhes in his preſence (you who have not quite ſinn'd out your Day) and put on Sack-cloth before him, if ſo be there may be hope, leſt he break you in pieces as a Potters Veſſel of Clay, and there be none to ſave you.</p>

                  <p>WHen the good will and loving kindneſs of God (who wills not the death nor deſtruction of any) hath been largely manifeſted unto a rebellious and ſtiff-necked Generation of people, in ſtriving with them by his good Spirit; and when he hath oft reach'd unto them with the viſitation of his Love, and called unto them (by the mouthes of his Servants, Prophets, and Meſſengers) to repent, and turn every one from his evil way, that they might be healed, and find mercy with the Lord, and yet they will have no regard thereunto; but refuſe to be reformed, and continue ſtill in their rebellion againſt the Light of his good Spirit in their hearts; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, hate, perſecute, and deſpitefully uſe the Servants and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God, whom in tender mercy, love and good will, he ſent unto them; I ſay after the long ſuffering and loving kindneſs of God hath been ſo largely (and on this wiſe) manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto a rebellious and ſtiff-necked people; who ſo evilly requite his love to them; is it not then juſtice in the Lord to ceaſe ſtriving with them, and to give them up to hardneſs of heart, and to ſeal his Decree againſt them, (in his wiſdom) to find out a way that their eyes may be cloſed, and their hearts hardned, leaſt they ſhould ſee, and underſtand, and be converted, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that ſo it may come upon them according to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> viz. <hi>He that oft-times is reproved, and ſtiffneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be cut off, and that without remedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore now conſider, Oh Nation of <hi>England,</hi> is not this the very ſtate of many of thy Inhabitants at this day? hath not the love and good will of God been largely
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93507:74"/>
manifeſted to them, in that he hath long ſtrove with them by his good Spirit in their hearts? and hath not his immortal Word of Life been plentifully declared amongſt them, even to the uttermoſt of thy borders every way? hath it not been line upon line, and precept upon precept unto them, even by the mouthes of his faithful Servants and Prophets whoſe cry in thy Streets hath oft, and long been, Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil wayes; why will die, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And did they not declare that Gods dreadful Judgments were nigh to be revealed upon them that would not repent, and turn from the Abominations againſt which they teſtified: But alas! few at all had regard thereunto; but many lookt upon it as an idle Tale, or as a whimſical Imagination, and refuſed to hear and fear, (even as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did in the day when Chriſt would have gathered her) and therefore now (in the Juſtice of God) is his Decree gone forth, and ſealed againſt many of them (as it was againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which was threatned and propheſied of by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Hand-maids) is begun to be revealed amongſt them, and in the midſt thereof he hath (in his wiſdom) found out a way to blind their Eyes, and to ſtop their Ears, and to harden their Hearts, leaſt they ſhould ſee and hear, and underſtand, and be converted and healed; for as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, He taketh away the perfect, and the wicked; and becauſe it is ſo, that (in this preſent Viſitation) he taketh away the Righteous from the Earth as well as the wicked; therefore the wicked cannot diſcern betwixt him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not, (according to that ſaying of <hi>Daniel,</hi> viz. None of the wicked ſhall underſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But they are ready to conclude, and many do conclude that the Righteous are not Righteous, and that the Juſt and Innocent are not Juſt and Innocent: But becauſe they have ſlighted the Day of Gods love unto them, (in which his Hand was ſtretched forth to gather them) he hath ſo brought it to paſs, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Juſt as well as the Unjuſt, that thereby their Eyes may be blinded, that they may not ſee a difference, and that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93507:75"/>
their years may be ſtopped left they ſhould hear his Word, and that their hearts may be hardned (as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> was) leſt they ſhould underſtand the way of Life, (in which the juſt walketh) and be converted thereunto and healed; and yet in all theſe thing iniquity cannot he charged upon the Lord, (becauſe he willed not their deſtruction, but did ſtrive with them long, and gave them ſpace to repent, but they repented not,) therefore their deſtruction is of themſelves; for when he would have gathered them they would not: therefore (I ſay) its of themſelves that they are left ſo deſolation; yet there is a remnant in the midſt of thee, (Oh <hi>England</hi>) whoſe day is not yet over, and them he will ſpare, and will gather them to himſelf, and they ſhall ſee the path of Life, and hear the voice of the Bridegroom of their ſouls, and underſtand the things that belongs to their everlaſting peace and ſhall be glad, and rejoyce in his great Salvation.</p>

                  <head>The VVhore Unvail'd, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>GReat is the controverſie at this day throughout <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> concerning the way of Worſhip and Salvation, and great is the confuſion that is about Faith, and Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even amongſt all profeſſing Chriſtianity; and many, and cruel are the murthers, that have been acted by them, one againſt another, about Faith, and Worſhip, ſince the Apoſtacy began; and ſince people forſook the right way, and went in <hi>Cains</hi> way, and in <hi>Balàams,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 11. For then perſecution began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the profeſt Chriſtians, and not before; and when the right way was forſaken, then people went into Envy, and then they withſtood the truth; even as <hi>Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes;</hi> and then they began to be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered (from the holy Mountain of the Lord, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things hurts, nor deſtroys) to the barren mountains, where they have been deſtroying one another; and there (in the dark and cloudy day of Antichriſt's reign) they have been worſhipping the many headed Beaſt; (that then aroſe) and alſo the Dragon, that gave power to the Beaſt to make War with the Saints; and they who have been worſhipping upon one mountain, they have cryed ſalvation is here: And they who have been worſhipping another head, or upon another hill, they have cried that ſalvation was to be found there: (For the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt are ſeven Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains upon which the Whore ſits, that drinks the Blood of the Saints.) And ſo they fell out one with another about the way of Salvation, &amp; upon theſe barren Mountains (unto
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93507:78"/>
which people are in looking for Salvation) the ſtrife and the envy hath been: And there people hath been killing one another about the way, and themſelves all out of the way, in an Antichriſtian, deſtroying, perſecuting ſpirit, as their fruits declare; for the Spirit of Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver led the true Chriſtians to perſecute any about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither doth any who are in the right way, kill and deſtroy mens lives about Religion; Nay, they that do ſo, are not true Chriſtians, but of an Antichriſtian ſpirit; for I teſtifie in the Name of the Lord, and for God, that the Spirit of Chriſt doth not (nor never did) admit, or allow of perſecution, or of deſtroying mens lives about Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Faith towards God; neither are any of them true Chriſtians (whatſoever they profeſs) that are found ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>For it is not a bare profeſſion of Chriſt, and of zeal for his cauſe, and crying up Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that makes people true Chriſtians, or that gives them acceptance with God, or will make them well-pleaſing unto God; But, that which makes a man a true Chriſtian, is (his obedience unto) that Spirit, which baptizeth into the true Faith, by which Righteouſneſs is wrought, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, who is the Author of faith, and will bring him to have the mind of Chriſt (as the true Chriſtians had) and will make him partaker of his divine nature, and will teach him to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World, and to do to all men, as he would they ſhould do unto him, which is according to the Law and Prophets, that Chriſt came to fulfil: And indeed, there is nothing that can bring a man into this true Chriſtian ſtate, but only the working and operation of the Spirit of Chriſt in his inward parts, which all ought to obey and ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: For, the perſecuting Jews, who were uncircumciſed in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93507:78"/>
heart and ears, and did alwaies reſiſt the holy Ghoſt; they profeſſed as great Zeal for God, and his Cauſe, as the Apoſtate <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now do; and they look'd for the coming of the Meſſiah, of whom all the Prophets propheſied, and profeſſed they would Adore him, and Reverence him, &amp;c. and ſaid, <hi>That, if they had been in the dayes of their Fathers, they would not have ſlain the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 23.31. who propheſied of the coming of Chriſt; and ſo they had ſeemingly a great Zeal for God, and his Truth: But, alas! a Murdering ſpirit was found in them; for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they profeſſed, <hi>That they would not have kill'd the Prophets;</hi> yet they kill'd the Son, who was the end of the Prophets: And although the Prophets ſignified the Time when, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. and the Place, where the Meſſiah ſhould be born, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2. yet when he was come, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prophets, which they profeſt; theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>Jews</hi> would not own him, nor receive him, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. becauſe he reprov'd their Hypocriſie, and their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſpirit, <hi>John</hi> 8.40. but they Crucified and Slew Him.</p>
                  <p>And this is the very State of the <hi>Apoſtate Chriſtians</hi> this day: For who is there now amongſt them, but will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs as great Love to Chriſt, as the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's dayes did to the Prophets, who propheſied of him? and who is there now among'ſt them, but will ſay; Had we been in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>'s dayes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And ſo the Perſecutors
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93507:79"/>
were in all ages blinded by the godd of the World, who was a murtherer from the beginning; and though they could ſee the iniquities of their fathers and predeceſſors, in perſecuting and killing the Prophets, yet the envy of their hearts was ſuch, that they could not ſee their own iniquities, in perſecuting and ſlaying the Son, who was greater than the Servants, whom their fathers ſlew: ſo, as I ſaid before, it is not a profeſſion of Chriſt, and his Ordinances, or zeal for his cauſe, that makes people true Chriſtians; neither is God Worſhipped upon any of thoſe mountains where the perſecuting and deſtroying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is; but the Worſhip of God conſiſteth in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that Spirit of Truth, which condemns all thoſe works of darkneſs and cruelty, <hi>and in his own Mountain of Holineſs, where nothing hurts nor deſtroys,</hi> Iſa. 11.9. And ſuch is the Father now ſeeking to worſhip him, that will worſhip him there; and is now gathering his Sheep from off the barren Mountains, upon which the Whore ſits, (where they have been ſcattered in the dark and cloudy day of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's reign, and where the Wars and Fightings are) <hi>even to his own Holy Mountain, where they ſhall learn war no more,</hi> Iſa. 2.4.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93507:79"/>
ſpoyling of our goods, and ſcourgings, and cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and impriſonments (many unto death, as this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her anguiſh muſt be made to know) but even all ſorts of <hi>Babylons</hi> Merchants, (or they that trades in every part of her, or within her Subburbs) have oft made it their buſineſs, to write and print againſt us, endeavouring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as much as in them lay, to render us odious, (to our own Nation, and to Nations about us) under pretence that we were Papiſts, and Jeſuits, and that we propagated Jeſuitical Principles, &amp;c. but they being almoſt, if not altogether, weary of that work, finding it to be to no purpoſe, (for the truth which we profeſs hath ſtill got ground, and flouriſheth through all theſe things) now at laſt, the Papiſts, or Jeſuits themſelves, (who, I perceive have a ſecret hope of a day once more in this Nation,) they begin to put out their heads, and to print againſt us; and ſo both Proteſtants and Papiſts, even every head and horn of the Beaſt, after whom the whole World wonders, are found puſhing againſt the Lamb and the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. For of late a certain Pamphlet accidentally came to my hands, written by a perfect <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, who ſubſcribed his name <hi>A.

I found my ſelf ſomewhat concerned to return a brief reply
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93507:80"/>
to his chief Arguments therein produced, by which he hath in vain) endeavour'd to accompliſh the aforeſaid work by him undertaken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> His firſt Argument, produced to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church, conſiſteth of nine particulars, as followeth; <hi>viz. That is the true Church, and no other, which is one, Holy Catholick, and Apoſtolick Church, Which is viſible, infallible, inerrable, in which is power of miracles, out of which none can be ſaved; But the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontificial, that is to ſay, the Faithful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, diſperſed all the World over, in communion with the high Prieſt, Biſhop, or Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is ſuch, and no other; Therefore the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontificial alone is the true Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> To which I reply, that the true Church; of which Chriſt alone is Head, and Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is in it ſelf one, holy, Apoſtolick Church, &amp;c. I ſhall not go about to deny: But as touching that grand Queſtion by <hi>A. S.</hi> ſtated before his Argument here inſerted <hi>(viz.) which is this Church,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, this is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed diſputable amongſt many, yea, amongſt many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, yet not at all queſtionable, nor yet doubtful unto me; for I am well ſatisfied therein, and in all other things that appertain to the way of Life and Salvation, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, (as <hi>A. S.</hi> affirmeth, and by his many Arguments hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove) I do not acknowledge, but deny, and doubt not but I ſhall, in this ſhort enſuing Treatiſe, prove the contrary, to the Satisfaction of every judicious Reader.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Although the true Church, of which Chriſt is in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Head, is one yet the oneneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a ſufficient Argument to prove her to be the true Church;

for wherein doth her oneneſs conſiſt, farther then in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Superſtition, Murther, and ſuch like abominations, of which much might be mentioned (which was never practiſed by the true Church in the Apoſtles dayes) but in theſe things the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is one: Witneſs her Worſhipping Idols, or Images, bowing to that ſhe calls her Altars, and the reſt of her Supeſtitious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; witneſs the Killing, Burning, or Drinking the Blood of ſo many Thouſands, as ſhe hath done for many hundred yeares paſt, as the whole <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> full well knows; therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And conſider, was not the company of Prieſts one in <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s dayes, who murthered in the way by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? whom the Prophet compared, to troops of Robbers, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.9. And is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> one as they were? for hath not ſhe murthered many (by conſent of moſt of her members) in the way that ſhe is in? conſider theſe things.</p>
                  <p>But then <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That ſhe is one in matters of Faith, and governed by one inviſible Head, Chriſt; and by one viſible Head, the Pope, the true Succeſſor of</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c. and therefore ſhe is the true Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; that ſhe is perfectly united in matters of Faith, I utterly deny: witneſs the Hiſtory of the Counſel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which copiouſly relates the Diviſions and Contradictions amongſt them there about matters of Faith. But admit that it were ſo, that ſhe were one in matters of Faith, that doth not prove her to be the true Church, unleſs ſhe could prove her Faith to be the true Faith, <hi>by which righteouſneſs is wrought, Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>And which is made perfect by works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, James</hi> 2.22. But the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Faith, (as her works of unrighteouſneſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93507:81"/>
before mentioned clearly make manifeſt) therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is governed by one inviſible Head, Chriſt; that I alſo deny, and her fruits before mentioned, and that which I ſhall hereafter mention, ſufficiently declares the contrary; and as Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, <hi>If you were of</hi> Abraham, <hi>you would do the works of</hi> Abraham, <hi>but now you go about to kill me; thus did not</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. So ſay I of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> If ſhe were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the one inviſible Head, Chriſt, as the true Church was, then ſhe would have the mind of Chriſt, (who came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them) as the true Church had, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.16. but ſhe hath not the mind of Chriſt: Witneſs her deſtroying the lives of many, not onely of thoſe that believe not, but of thoſe that believe: Therefore ſhe is not governed by the inviſible Head, Chriſt, and conſequently is not the true Church, but the Whore that drinks the blood of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is governed by her viſible Head, the Pope, I ſhall not go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict; for although that proves her to be one, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Pope, yet it doth not prove her to be the true Church; becauſe Chriſt never ordained a viſible Head to his Church; but that the Pope is the true Succeſſor of <hi>Peter</hi> (as <hi>A. S.</hi> affirms) that I do deny; and it remains for him to prove it, or for ſome of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to do it for him; for after <hi>Peter</hi> was converted, he never gave conſent to the murthering of any, as the Pope hath done many; Therefore he is not the true Succeſſor of <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the true Chu ch is holy; or (as <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith the ſpotleſs Body of Chriſt, that I do acknowledg; but the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93507:81"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (of which the Pope is viſible head) is not holy, nor the ſpotleſs Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the ſpotleſs Body of Chriſt (the true Church) was baptized with the holy Ghoſt and with fire, the Spirit of Judgment and of burning, and thereby her filth and her ſpots were purged away from her, and ſhe was waſhed from Idolatry and covetouſneſs, &amp;c. as the Apoſtles teſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and thereby ſhe was fitted for Gods Kingdom, and was made to ſit together in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in Chriſt Jeſus, and had the mind of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. who came not to deſtroy mens lives, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.56. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not waſhed from Idolatry, nor free from Murther, as her worſhipping of Idols or Images doth teſtifie; and as her killing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying about Religion, and Worſhip beareth witneſs (which the Spirit of Chriſt never allowed of, not the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Body of Chriſt never practiſed.) Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not holy, nor the ſpotleſs Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And as to that affirmation of <hi>A. S.</hi> in the third Number of his firſt Chapter <hi>(viz.) Every man as he is Regenerated in Chriſt, and a member of his body, is holy, and a Saint, though as he is the Son of</hi> Adam, <hi>be is a lyar and a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, That the moſt part of all the Sectaries in the World will joyn with him in that particular; therefore he need not ſo much cry againſt them: but the True Church will not own that Doctrine, neither can I own it, becauſe it is the Doctrine of Devils, and the Spirit of God teſtifies againſt it. For it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to be both a Saint and a ſinner at one ſeaſon: for if that could be, then might a man ſerve two Maſters, which Chriſt ſaid could not be, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.13. And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He that commits ſin, is the Servant of ſin,</hi> Joh. 8.34. and is free from righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. So hath no
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93507:82"/>
part in Chriſt, who is the righteouſneſs of God. And whoſoever loveth or maketh a Lye, ſhall not enter the Holy City; which is the true Church, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27. Therefore is no member of it. Now let <hi>A. S.</hi> conſider his Ignorance, for according to his own confeſſion, the true Church is built of living believers (elect and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) but he that is a lyer and a ſinner, is dead <hi>(for the ſoul that ſins ſhall dye,</hi> Ezek. 18.4.) Therefore, he that is a Lyer and a Sinner, is not a living Believer, nor yet holy, and a Saint: Yet I do not deny, but that he that is regenerated in Chriſt, and is baptized into him, and is thereby made a member of his ſpotleſs body, is holy and a Saint; for by and through the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he is redeemed out of the firſt fallen <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Well, but <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That all the members of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>are baptized and ſanctified in Chriſt, and that all her Inſtitutes and Ceremonies, &amp;c. are holy, and therefore ſhe is holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny it, and he cannot prove it; for all who are baptized into Chriſt (and are ſanctified in him) have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. and doth live holy, and have the mind of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not the mind of Chriſt, neither doth ſhe live holy (as afore proved;) Therefore ſhe is not holy. And as concerning her Inſtitutions and Ceremonies, as Bowing to Images, and Altars, and ſuch things we never read that the holy Church in the Primitive times, did practice ſuch things; therefore we have no ground to believe they are holy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the true Church is Catholick or Univerſal, I ſhall not go about to deny: but I do deny that the Univerſality of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a ſufficient Argument to prove her to be the true Church; for conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93507:82"/>1. What Church is more Univerſal then the great Whore (the falſe Church) who hath a name written, <hi>MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF THE EARTH,</hi> Rev. 7.5. Who ſits upon the many waters, which are Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, and People? <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. And did not the Whole World, wonder after the Beaſt, that carries the Whore? <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3.

And did not all the Inhabitants of the Earth, and the Kings of the Earth drink of the Wine of her Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and commit Fornication with her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. (Mark) how univerſal was this great Whore, the falſe Church, and how confident ſhe was? for ſhe ſaid in her heart, <hi>that ſhe ſhould ſee no ſorrow,</hi> Rev. 18.7. And did ſhe not <hi>glorifie her ſelf, and reign over the kings of the Earth?</hi> Rev. 17.18. mark this thing. Is not this the very ſtate of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now at this day? doth ſhe not reign over the Kings of the Earth, and over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth? and hath ſhe not ſo done long, even for many ages? Witneſs <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> the firſt <hi>Volume,</hi> which copiouſly relates the Authority ſhe hath exerciſed over Kings, and how Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> made <hi>Fredricus</hi> the Emperour hold his ſtirrup while he got upon his horſe; yea, and ſhent him for his pains, becauſe the poor Emperour (not being us'd to that work) held his ſtirrup on the wrongſide of his horſe.</p>
                  <p>And again, Did not the great Whore (which <hi>John</hi> ſpake of) <hi>drink the blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus?</hi> as Rev. 17.6. And was ſhe not to have blood given her to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93507:83"/>
drink? And hath not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> drunk the blood of many thouſands of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus? Surely the Hiſtories of many Generations paſt will teſtifie ſhe hath: Therefore ſhe is not the true Church, but the Whore.</p>
                  <p>And have not many Nations gone into her, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication with her? and doth ſhe not ſit upon many Waters? the People, Kindreds, Tongues, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? and this kind of univerſality ſhe makes uſe of, as an argument to prove that ſhe is the true Church: which may be truly ſaid to be a part of her Witchcrafts and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries, with which ſhe hath long bewitched the Nations, even all this long night of Apoſtacy, in which Antichriſt hath reigned, who hath blinded the inviſible eye in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with this ſame pittiful ſhallow ſtuff ſhe would fain ſtill blind that eye which God hath opened in us: But bleſſed be the Lord, the day is dawned which makes all things manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And farther, conſider what a ſlender, or blind Argument it is, to plead univerſality to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church. Surely <hi>A. S.</hi> did not conſider, that they are many, who goes in the broad way that leads to deſtruction, and that the whole World wondred after the Beaſt that carries the Whore, the falſe Church; neither did he conſider that they are but few who finds (and walks in) the ſtraight way which leads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life; for had he conſidered theſe things, he would have been aſhamed to have produced ſuch an Argument to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church. But its clear that the univerſal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſits upon the many Waters, and reigns over the Kings of the Earth, and goes in the broad way; Therefore ſhe is not the true Church, but the Whore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93507:83"/>Fourthly, Again, That the true Church is Apoſtolick, and built upon the Foundation of the holy Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. and was propagated through the World by the Apoſtles, that I acknowledge, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Apoſtolick, or had her beginning in Chriſt and his Apoſtles, (as <hi>A. S.</hi> affirmeth) or that ſhe was propagated through the World by the Apoſtles, in that diſcipline (Ceremonies, worſhipping of Idols, or Images, Murthering the People of God, &amp;c.) in which ſhe now ſtands, that I do deny, and its Abomination in <hi>A. S.</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. For conſider;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When, or where did Chriſt, or his Apoſtles begin the practice of Bowing to Images, or Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Idols? or when did any of them Bow to an Alter of Wood, or Pray with a String of Beads, or Pray to Saints, or carry a Silver, or Wooden Croſs about with them, or Murder any becauſe they were not of their Faith? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot prove that ever Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles began, or practiſed any of theſe things; nor that they were in being in their dayes, we defie them; but they are inventions ſet up in the falſe Church, in the dark Night of Apoſtacy, that hath been over the Nations ſince the Apoſtles dayes, and are practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to this day; Therefore ſhe is not Apoſtolick, but Apoſtate like.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That the true Church, or the Members of it are viſible, I ſhall not deny; and that ſhe is the Light of the World, I do confeſs; but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, or the Light of the World, becauſe ſhe is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I do not acknowledge, but deny; for although the true Church, or the Members of it, are viſible, yet ſo is the Whore alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93507:84"/>But then ſome will ſay, How are they then to be diſtinguiſhed? Firſt, I anſwer, <hi>By their fruits?</hi> as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thiſtles,</hi> Matth. 7.16. <hi>neither can one Fountain, ſend forth bitter Water and ſweet,</hi> James 3.12. <hi>nor a good Tree cannot bring forth bad fruit;</hi> But the viſible Church of <hi>Rome</hi> brings forth bad fruits, and ſends forth bitter Waters, as the Cruelties exerciſed by her, and the Murthers ſhe hath acted for Ages paſt teſtifieth; and as the Idolatries exerciſed in her to this day (as before mentioned) witneſſeth: For ſuch things was never exerciſed by, nor in the true Church, in Chriſts nor the Apoſtles dayes; therefore though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be viſible, yet her fruits teſtifieth, that ſhe is not the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Again <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, (and diabolically affirms in the ſecond Page of his pretended Reconciler of Religions) <hi>That the true Church is compoſed of both good and bad, wheat, and tares;</hi> which I do abominate to acknowledge, and is blaſphemy in him to affirm: for the true Church is built of <hi>Living Stones,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>Elect and Precious;</hi> or (as <hi>A. S.</hi> affirmeth) of living Believers: but no living Believers can be truly called the bad, nor the tares, but elect and precious; and all that are living, or precious, are the good; therefore the true Church is built of the good only.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but if the Church of Chriſt (which <hi>A. S.</hi> in his ſecond page, affirmeth is the Kingdom of Chriſt) be compoſed of both good and bad, then according to his own affirmation, the Kingdom of Chriſt is part good, and part bad, which is horrid blaſphemy in <hi>A. S.</hi> to affirm.</p>
                  <p>Oh groſs darkneſs and confuſion! Art thou a Member
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93507:84"/>
of the Church that calls it ſelf the light of the World? Oh, dark, dull, gloomy light! the Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bring all his people out of that dark Cell, that they may walk in his marvellous Light, which makes all things mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of what ſort it is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, But if you ſay that Chriſt likened the Kingdom to a Net that was caſt into the Sea, which gathered of all Kinds;—I anſwer he did ſo; yet when it came to Land, there was none compoſed, or gathered into the veſſels, but the good only, and the bad were caſt away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.48. Therefore the true Church is not compoſed of both good and bad, but of the good only.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, but if you object, that the tares and wheat were both to grow together in the Fleld; I anſwer, they Were ſo untill the Harveſt; <hi>(and the Fleld is the World,</hi> Mat. 23.39. but the true Church is not of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.14.) but when the Reapers were ſent forth (which were the Angels, that had the Goſpel to preach, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. who went to diſciple people, and to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them into the true Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.) Their Commiſſion was to compoſe or gather the Wheat only, and to ſeperate the Tares from it, and to bind them in bundles for the Fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30. and therefore the true Church is not compoſed of both Wheat and Tares, but of Wheat only.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Farther, If you ſay that there were ſome in the true Church, in the Apoſtles days, that were falſe brethren, and theſe were bad; I anſwer, Though they were amongſt them, yet they were not of them: as the Apoſtle ſaid, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. Therefore the true Church is not compoſed of both good and bad, but of the good only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93507:85"/>But to return to the fifth part of <hi>A. S.</hi> his Argument, where he ſaith, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is known to the World, in her Biſhops, Paſtors, and Believers, &amp;c. And therefore ſhe is viſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although that proves her viſible, yet it doth not prove her to be the true Church, but the contrary; For the true Church, that was the light of the World, was not known to the World, <hi>John</hi> 17.14. but the viſible Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is known to the World, (as <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf affirmeth) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe is not the true Church, but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Again, the true Church wreſtled not with fleſh and blood, neither were her weapons carnal, but ſpiritual, and ſhe wreſtled with ſpiritual wickedneſſes that were in the high places, and broke down the ſtrong holds of iniquity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wreſtles with fleſh and blood, and kills mens bodies about Religion; as the whole <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> knoweth; and the ſpiritual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes are ſtill ſtanding in her, as afore proved, and as all the World ſufficiently knows; therefore ſhe is not the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The infallibleneſs of the true Church, of which Chriſt is ſupreme Head &amp; Governour, I do not go about to deny; but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible, that I do deny. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Although <hi>A. S.</hi> hath affirmed, that ſhe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remained ſince Chriſt's time unto this day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption &amp;c. yet he never proved it; neither can he do it; for, as before I have ſaid, we never read that the true Church in Chriſt's dayes was found in ſuch things; neither was ſuch things then found in her as is now found in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is now found in: by which it is clear, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93507:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhe hath not alwayes remained ſince Chriſts time in the ſtate ſhe now ſtands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But if ſhe hath alwayes remained, ſince Chriſt time to this day, without interruption (as <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith ſhe hath) then ſhe cannot poſſibly be the true Church; for the true Church was interrupted ſince the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, (and yet remained, as hereafter I ſhall ſhew;) and in the Apoſtles dayes her interruption began, and ſome of the Apoſtles foreſaw it, and ſaid, <hi>of your ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things,</hi> Acts 20.30. and when they were ariſen, <hi>they withſtood the truth, as</hi> Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jambres <hi>withſtood</hi> Moſes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. ſo here the interruption of the true Church began: and after this <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Dragon (interrupting, or) perſecuting her into the Wilderneſs, <hi>where ſhe had a place prepared of God, that they might feed her there, a thouſand, two hundred, and threeſcore dayes,</hi> Rev. 12.6. and ver. 13, 14. concerning which, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter; ſo on this wiſe the true Church was interrupted ſince Chriſts dayes: But <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remained ſince Chriſts time without interruption; Therefore ſhe is not the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And whereas <hi>A. S.</hi> farther ſaith, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall always remain to the end of the World; and therefore ſhe is infallible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, He hath not at all confirmed that by any proof, neither hath he any farther proof than his own affirmation; except he would produee that ſaying of the Mother of Harlots, (viz.) <hi>I ſit as a Queen, and am no Widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow,</hi> Rev. 18.7. And indeed that would be a very pittiful Argument to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> infallible; but none other can he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce (except he could firſt prove her to be the true Church,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93507:86"/>
which he is never able to do; his beſt Argument by which he hath undertaken it, being already confuted) Therefore we have no more cauſe to believe his Affirmation, than we have to believe the ſayings of the forementioned Mother of Harlots, for they are both alike to us; and though ſhe ſaid, ſhe ſhould ſee no ſorrow, yet <hi>John</hi> (who was in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord) ſaid, <hi>that in one day her Deſolation ſhould come,</hi> Rev. 18.8. And although <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall alwayes remain to the end of the World;</hi> yet I ſay, in the Name of the Lord, and by the ſame Spirit that <hi>John</hi> was in, That the one day, of which <hi>John</hi> ſpake, is already dawned, in which the Deſolation of that Great Whore, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall come; and as ſurely, as when <hi>Sodom</hi> was overthrown, the Cities round about it were overthrown alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 7. ſo certainly, when this great City <hi>Babylon</hi> is overthrown, and made deſolate, the Suburbs thereof ſhall be overthrown, and made deſolate alſo. The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, and therefore ſhe muſt fail in her Propheſies, and ceaſe in her Beeing, which, as <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, the true Church cannot.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, And farther, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is variable in her Judgments, as the diverſities of Councels that ſhe hath held concerning matters of Faith, beareth witneſs; for the following General Counſel hath oft-times excluded that, which was concluded on by the former: and ſurely both cannot be infallible, they being quite contradictory one to the other. Read the 15th chapter of <hi>F. H.</hi> his Book, entituled, THE GLORY OF THE TRUE CHURCH DISCOVERED, &amp;c. wherein the contradictions of the General Counſels which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath held, are ſufficiently made manifeſt; ſo that I need not trouble my ſelf to inſert them here: and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93507:86"/>
thereby its evident enough, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not infallible.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Again, if <hi>A. S.</hi> or any other, could prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had alwayes remained ſince Chriſts time; yet, as aforeſaid, that is not a ſufficient Argument to prove her infallible, or that ſhe cannot fail, nor ceaſe. For conſider, the Dragon, that old Serpent, called the Devil, who was a Murtherer from the beginning, (who gave power to the Beaſt that carries the Whore, that drinks the Saints blood, that ſaid ſhe ſhould ſee no ſorrow) was before the dayes of Chriſt's appearance in the fleſh, yet the Dragon is not infallible; But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is upheld by the Murtherer, or carried by the Dragons power in the Beaſt, as the Murthers acted by her beareth witneſs; therefore ſhe is no more infallible than the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, And as to the 7th part of <hi>A. S.</hi> his Argument, wherein he ſaith, <hi>The True Church is inerrable,</hi> and then ſaith, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is this inerrable True Church: for all the Sectaries, Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks in the World,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>could never yet ſhew wherein ſhe erred, nor ever ſhall: Therefore ſhe is inerrable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, although the Hereticks could not prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, yet there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who are members of the true Church, of which Chriſt is Head, and ſupreme Governour alone, that can prove wherein ſhe hath erred, and doth ſtill groſly err from the Doctrine, Practice, and Diſcipline of the true Church, as it ſtood in the Apoſtles dayes: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in his dayes ſaid, <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own Conſcience,</hi> Rom. 14.5. and did not go about to force People to conform to ſuch things, that they were not perſwaded of in their conſciences, nor to compel them by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93507:87"/>
outward Laws to conform thereunto; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not admit, that every one ſhould walk or act, according as they are perſwaded in their own Conſciences, but goes about by outward Laws to compel them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to that which ſhe calls her holy Ordinances and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, which many, for conſcience ſake towards Gods, dare not conform to, becauſe they know them to be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Idolatries; and they, who cannot for Conſcience ſake ſubmit to her Impoſitions, or drink of her Cup of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, then to be ſure ſhe will drink their Blood: Witneſs the Blood ſhe hath drunk (for above this thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years paſt) of them that could not, for Conſcience ſake towards God, conform to her Ordinances: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe hath erred from that Spirit which was in the true Church, and from the Apoſtles Doctrine, and is ſtill in the Error.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the true Church in the Apoſtles dayes, every one, as he had received the Gift of the Spirit of God, ſo he might Adminiſter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets might ſpeak two or three; and if any thing was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him that ſtood by, he might ſpeak, and the firſt ſhould be ſilent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29, 30, 31. But this is not the order of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is ſufficiently manifeſted to all <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> therefore ſhe hath erred from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Spirit and Order, and is ſtill in the Error: And thus I might produce many more Arguments, to ſhew wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, and doth err, only my deſire is to be as brief as may be, ſo that ſatisfaction may be given: for which I doubt not but this is ſufficient, as to that particular.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And as concerning Miracles in the true Church, I do confeſs and bear witneſs, that there are Miracles wrought in her daily; but that all Miracles are an Argument ſufficient
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93507:87"/>
to prove a people to be the true Church; that I do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but deny: For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> could by their Sorceries, or Inchantments imitate thoſe things in the ſight of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did by the Power of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.7. and the falſe Prophet he wrought lying Miracles before the Beaſt that carries the Whore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he cauſed fire to come down out of Heaven in the ſight of men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13, 14. and <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And this the Whore might have ſaid was done in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of her faith &amp; doctrines; (as <hi>A. S.</hi> doth) yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it was done by the Dragons power, who was a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the beginning; For he gave power to the Beaſt (that carries the Whore) to do ſuch things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. and therefore the Miracles in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (if now there be any) is no infallible evidence to prove her to be the true Church. Well,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But then it may be ſome will ſay, that this is harſh judgment, and how can you tell but that the Miracles wrought in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are wrought by the Power of God? or how can you diſtinguiſh between Miracles wrought by the Power of God, and Miracles wrought by the Dragons power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, we have an infallible way to judge in this particular; For, all Miracles wrought by the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, are not wrought by the Power of God, but by the Dragons power, for the Dragon, that old Serpent, who is called the Devil, was a Murderer from the beginning, (but Chriſt the Power of God, is not a murdering power, <hi>for he came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luke 9.56. Therefore the Miracles wrought by Chriſt, the Power of God, are not wrought by a murdering power) But the Miracles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (if now there be any)

are wrought by a murdering power; for the many murders ſhe hath acted, ſufficiently teſtifieth to the whole <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that a murdering power rules in her: By which its clear, that the Miracles wrought in the Church of <hi>Rome,)</hi> if there be any) are wrought by the Dragons power, and not by the Power of God: So that my judgement concerning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not harſh, but according to the Spirit of Truth and ſound Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but for all <hi>A. S.</hi> in his Epiſtle Dedicatory, hath made ſuch a great noiſe about Miracles wrought by a Roman Catholick Prieſt in and about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> yet when he comes to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is powerful in Miracles, then he doth juſt as much as nothing, but takes an eaſie way to get out from that thing, which ſeemingly he undertook to go thorow with, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of us for a witneſs of his Affirmation to <hi>noſtre dame de Loretto, noſtre dame de Montague, noſtre dame de Hall,</hi> and to the whole World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now what a pittiful proof or witneſs is this, which <hi>A. S.</hi> directs us to; For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaith, <hi>the whole World lies in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.19. and wonders after the Beaſt, by whom lying Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are wrought, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3. So that the Miracles which the World bears witneſs to, are lying Miracles; for the World knows not Chriſt, nor his Church, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. by whom true Miracles are wrought; for when Chriſt wrought Miracles amongſt the World, they did not bear witneſs to him, but ſaid he did it by the Prince of Devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.34. So that the witneſs that <hi>A. S.</hi> calls for, confirmeth my forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Affirmation, <hi>viz.</hi> That, the Miracles in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are wrought by the Dragons power in the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, that the whole World wonders after.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and for <hi>noſtre dame de Loretto,</hi> and the reſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93507:89"/>
they ſignifie nothing as to our ſatisfaction in this particular, becauſe they are altogether unknown to us; neither can we attain to a certain knowledge of them, if we would; for the information of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to us no ſatisfaction; ſo as I ſaid before (that <hi>A. S.)</hi> for matter of proving his Affirmation, hath done juſt as much as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; only made a ſhew, like a Cloud without Rain: But methinks, if there were ſo many Miracles wrought daily, by a Roman Prieſt about <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>A. S.</hi> ſeems to make a noiſe of; he ſhould have inſtanced ſome of them particularly for our ſatisfaction: but ſeeing he hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced any, we have juſt cauſe to believe, that there are none at all.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, So to proceed to the ninth part of <hi>A. S.</hi> his firſt Argument, <hi>viz. Out of the True Church none can be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That thing I do not at all deny, for all that are ſaved are of the true Church; but that none can be ſaved out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I do deny; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church, but the Whore that drinks the Blood of the Saints, as afore-proved; therefore out of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> people may be ſaved. Wherefore let all who expect or deſire Salvation make haſte out of this great City <hi>Babylon:</hi> And run for your lives towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the holy City, the true Church, the Lambs Wife, in whoſe Light the Nations of them that are ſaved muſt walk, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.24. leſt you periſh within the Borders of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe deſolation ſhall certainly come in one day: Yea, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, for ſtrong is the Lord, who (is now ariſen and) judgeth her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Myſtery of the Whore far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovered.</note>Well, But if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, That ſhe doth not drink the blood of the Saints, but the blood of Hereticks, &amp;c. and therefore ſhe is the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93507:90"/>1. I anſwer, ſo, or to that effect, ſaid the Deſtroyers and Murderers in all Ages, even they that put Chriſt to death; they did it not in their own account, as he was the Son of God, but as a Blaſphemer; and the Apoſtles were perſecuted as Spreaders of Hereſie, and Shedders of Sedition, and not as Saints and Servants of the Lord, in their Adverſaries account, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.5. and thus the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering perſecuting ſpirit hath in all Ages, as at this day ſought to ſhelter it ſelf, but this covering muſt now be ript off, for the Power of God is ariſen that rends the vail of Darkneſs, and the Day is dawned that makes all things manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And further; If they were Heretick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe blood the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> drinks, yet that doth not argue that ſhe is the true Church, but the contrary; for the true Church did never drink the blood of Hereticks, nor perſecute any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Hereticks; but the greateſt puniſhment that ever Chriſt appointed for Hereticks, was, that they ſhould account them as <hi>Publicans,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> Mat. 18.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So its clear, that Chriſt the Power of God, and the true Church that had the mind of Chriſt, did never kill, nor perſecute any becauſe they were Hereticks, or did not believe, nor yet becauſe (after they believed) they made ſhipwrack of faith; but laboured in the Spirit of Love and Meekneſs, to reſtore them, and to convince them by ſound Doctrine; but if they refuſed to receive admonition, or to ſubmit to the Church after due admonition given, then they let them receive the puniſhment aforeſaid, and refuſed to have fellowſhip with them, and this was the greateſt puniſhment that ever the true Church inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, though they were Rebellious, and this was the way to make true Believers of people, which force and compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by penal Laws will never do: though its true, compulſive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93507:90"/>
Laws may make many of them Hypocrites, who fears man more then God; but they who fears not man that can kill the body, and can do no more, but fears the Lord God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty above all, ſuch will not bow to the compulſive Laws of men, which violates the righteous Law of God in their own hearts, (no more then <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego</hi> would bow to the Image that <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> ſet up) though for their ſtedfaſtneſs they ſuffer the pangs of death, as many of their Predeceſſors have done, whoſe blood the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath drunk.</p>
                  <p>Thus much in brief to the nine particulars of <hi>A. S.</hi> his firſt Argument, by which (I perceive) he thought he had infallibly proved the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church; but what his Argument is worth for his purpoſe, let all who reads this judge.</p>
                  <p>And the next thing he undertakes, is, to prove <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock or Foundation upon which Chriſt built his Church; and to accompliſh this deſign, he rambles through ſeveral Languages, into which the Scripture hath bin tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; and in the concluſion he ſaith (a great lie) <hi>to</hi> Peter <hi>then Chriſt ſaid, upon thee I will build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. when none of the ſeveral Languages (which he makes uſe of to prove it) ſay any ſuch thing, according to his own interpretation of them; and indeed its blaſphemy in <hi>A. S.</hi> to affirm it: But then he ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt is the primary Rock, and</hi> Peter <hi>the ſecondary Rock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> But how can that be, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Rock, for <hi>A. S.</hi> cannot prove that God ever or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, or appointed a ſecondary Rock to build his Church on, (neither do we in all the Scriptures read of a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rock once mentioned) for the Apoſtle affirmeth the contrary, ſaying, <hi>Another Foundation can no man lay, then that which is already laid,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.11. <hi>which is Jeſus
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93507:91"/>
Chriſt:</hi> So he is the firſt, and the laſt, the beginning and the end; and <hi>A. S.</hi> his Affirmation is nothing worth for his purpoſe: nay, its worſe then nothing, for it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his Deceit and Ignorance, though I perceive his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and aim was to gratifie his Maſter the Pope, by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Supremacy, under pretence of ſetting <hi>Peter</hi> above the reſt of the Apoſtles, when indeed, its manifeſt enough, that his intent was to ſet up the Pope, as Lord and Maſter over Gods Heritage, Gentile like, contrary to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our [one] Lord Chriſt, <hi>viz. Be not many Maſters, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren,</hi> Mat- 23.8. So that <hi>Peter</hi> was not ſet up as a viſible head over, the Church of Chriſt, as <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith the Pope is over the. Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither was <hi>Peter</hi> above other of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but a fellow-Servant with them, and they all fellow-workers together with Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. and <hi>Paul</hi> was not at all inferiour to <hi>Peter</hi> (in relation to his ſpiritual authority) for he himſelf ſaid (yet not boaſtingly, but truly) <hi>that he came not behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. So that <hi>Peter</hi> was no more the Rock then <hi>Paul</hi> was; and what was <hi>Paul;</hi> or what was <hi>Apollo;</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but Miniſters by whom the Church believed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5?</p>
                  <p>So it was not the work of the Apoſtles to ſet themſelves one above another, for <hi>they abaſed themſelves, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt might be exalted:</hi> Neither did they preach themſelves, <hi>but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, and themſelves Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. by which it appears that the Pope doth not truly ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame ſpirit that he and the reſt of the Apoſtles were in, who had the Spirit and mind of Chriſt, who made himſelf of no reputation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. but the Pope truly ſucceeds thoſe whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaw would come, that would be <hi>covetous Boaſters, and

proud Blaſphemers,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.2. as doth appear by his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himſelf, and his boaſting of his great power and ſuperiority, witneſs <hi>Fox his Acts, the firſt Volume</hi> pag. 1023. <hi>and ſo on;</hi> where you may read at large how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſufficiently declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>covetous Boaſters,</hi> and <hi>proud Blaſphemers,</hi> and have alſo laid themſelves open enough to the view of all who have an eye to ſee, ſo that I need not produce any farther Argument to prove the <hi>Pope</hi> a proud Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

Indeed theſe, and many other her abominations, are innumerable, as ſhe her ſelf full well knows; therefore ſhe is indeed faln, and deeply revolted from that pure Spirit, in which the true Church ſtood in the Apoſtles dayes: Thence ſhe is faln, and the time when ſhe fell, was, when ſhe began to enter into theſe aforeſaid abominations that is now found in her.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, Although all the Sectaries in the World cannot anſwer thoſe queſtions; yet there are many, who are Members of the true Church (not of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) that can anſwer them; and firſt, I ſay there hath remained another Church ſince Chriſts time to this day (beſides the <hi>Roman Pontificial</hi> that now is) though not without interruption; yet the true Church (as before proved) was interrupted.

                  <p>I anſwer, ſhe was in <hi>Johns</hi> day <hi>a wonder in Heaven, a Woman cloathed with the Sun</hi> (that and there ſhe was) <hi>and the Moon was under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars,</hi> Rev. 12.1.

                  <p>And for her <hi>Biſhops, Paſtors, and Believers that ſhe had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Chriſt was, and is her Biſhop and chief Paſtor, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. And the reſt (after the Apoſtles days) were they that fed her in the Wilderneſs; and her Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were thoſe that had the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> Rev. 12.17. whoſe Blood the Whore drunk. And they are now her Believers, whoſe Blood the Whore thirſts after. And as to that queſtion <hi>(viz.) What Emperors or Kings did adhere to her, or now do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, On this wiſe did the Phariſees Query with thoſe Officers whom they ſent to take Jeſus and bring him unto them, ſaying, <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him?</hi> Joh. 7.48. Well, what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors or Kings did adhere to him at that time? Was he not therefore the true Chriſt, becauſe the Rulers of the World, and the Phariſees rejected him? And what ſaid the Apoſtle to the true Church in his day? <hi>You ſee your calling, Brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the Fleſh, not many mighty, nor noble,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this World, to confound the wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that Fleſh might not glory in his Preſence,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26, 27. And further, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (who preacht Chriſt) ſaid, <hi>That he preached the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in a Miſtery, which none of the Princes of the World know,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 2.7, 8. By which it appeares, that none of the Princes of the World knew Chriſt, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. And the true Church was in the World as Chriſt was; for the Apoſtle ſaid, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſo are we in this preſent World, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. <hi>And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93507:94"/>
World knows as not,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>becauſe it knew not him.</hi> So that underſtanding the Princes of this World knew not Chriſt, when he was amongſt them, and although the Rulers believed not in him, nor did adhere to him, when he was come; yet that did not argue, that he was not the true Chriſt. And notwithſtanding it was ſo, that the true Church was unknown to the World, and was compoſed not of many wiſe men after the fleſh, nor of the Nobles of the Earth, but was perſecuted by them (as ſhe is at this day) yet ſhe was the true Church for all that.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing it was ſo, that the Princes and Rulers did not adhere to her, in the time of her flouriſhing ſtate (when ſhe was cloathed with the Sun) how can it be expected that they ſhould adhere to her in her perſecuted ſtate, and in her mourning Wilderneſs-ſtate (for a <hi>rich man</hi> ſhall very hardly enter the Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.23. but there is more in them words) And moreover, ſeeing the Kings of the Earth committed Fornication with the great Whore, and went into her, how then can it poſſibly be expected that they ſhould adhere to the true Church? Surely all who have a ſpiritual eye open, may be hereby ſatisfied as to this particular. And further, as to that Query <hi>(viz.) What general Councils did ſhe hold, and what Hereticks did ſhe Condemn?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, ſhe hath not been in a capacity in her Wilderneſs-ſtate to hold General Counſels, as in the time of her flouriſhing ſtate; yet the mighty God hath alwayes been her wonderful Counſellor, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. and the Members of her hath ſtood in (and held to) his Counſel, according to the manifeſtation thereof received by them, not loving their lives unto death, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> well knows, (who have drunk the blood of many of them) or ſhall know
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93507:94"/>
to her ſorrow and pangs. And as for the true Churches condemning Hereticks; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> knows, that thoſe members of her, whoſe blood ſhe hath drunk, did alwayes condemn thoſe Hereſies, that are healed, and the Idolatries acted in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did always give Teſtimony againſt her Superſtitious inventions, and denied to have Fellowſhip with her therein, and looked upon her as reprobated from the true Faith (as <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts</hi> copiouſly relates) and this was a great Condemnation, as the Spirit of Chriſt gave commiſſion to the true Church to paſs upon Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Again, as to that queſtion, <hi>viz. What Academies did ſhe erect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, A people Erecting of Academies, is not an Argument ſufficient to prove them to be the true Church; for what Academies, or Univerſities did the Apoſtles erect or confirm, or attain the Knowledge of God in? Was it not the Light that ſhined in their Hearts, that gave them this knowledge? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. And was not this Light the Law, that was the Apoſtles Schoolmaſter till Chriſt? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. And is not the Law which is Light, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.23. written in the hearts of all people? And is it not a ſufficient Schoolmaſter now, to bring people (who are taught by it) unto the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Chriſt, as it did the Apoſtles then? What need then is there of erecting Academies; for people cannot attain to the Knowledg of God by natural Learning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. nor thereby be made true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. Yet I am not againſt having an outward School-houſe, or ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place for the educating, or bringing up of children in Natural Learning, which is good in its place; but that any can thereby be brought to the Knowledge of God, or made true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, that I cannot own. Neither was this way of making Miniſters by Natural-Learning, or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93507:95"/>
ſetting of them up by man, in being, untill people had forſaken the right way, and went into <hi>Cains</hi> way, and <hi>Balaams,</hi> and then the envy and murder began amongſt the profeſt Chriſtians, and then they could not endure ſound Doctrine, but heapt up to themſelves Teachers according, to their own hearts luſts, who knew nothing but what they knew naturally, as bruit Beaſts, &amp;c. and this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw; and wote of to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. and <hi>Peter</hi> propheſied of them alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> ſaw them come; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. <hi>Jude</hi> 10.11. ſo that by natural learning, and ordination of man, no true Miniſter of Chriſt was ever made, or ſent forth; but contrariwiſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Miniſter, <hi>(viz.)</hi> not of man, nor by men, nor yet by natural learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 1.1. ſo we do not underſtand that in the Apoſtles dayes they did erect Accademies, or that they had any need of them, and indeed I cannot but look upon it as an Ignorant queſtion to be propoſed by <hi>A. S.</hi> upon this account. But to his next Query, <hi>viz. What Churches and Monaſteries did ſhe build?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, this is as Ignorant a queſtion as the former, and great fooliſhneſs to ask, what Churches the Church built? however this I ſay, they who were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the true Church, did <hi>build up one another in their moſt holy faith,</hi> Jude 20. And as for Monaſteries, or Monk-houſes, we hear of ſuch thing that was in being in the Apoſtles dayes, neither do we believe that there is any need of them; for we do not read in the holy Scriptures, that ever the true Church, in any Generation, built ſuch places; but we know, that many ſuch places have been erected and built within the borders of the great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſince the Apoſtacy began, and ſince the right
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93507:95"/>
way was forſaken, and many other Superſtitious inventions and Idolatries, as before hinted, hath been ſet up, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Beaſts and Dragons worſhip, <hi>all which God hath determined to throw down; and when the Deſolation of all theſe things cometh, and the ſeven Mountains upon which the Whore ſits, comes to be laid waſte, according as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in Ages paſt,</hi> Iſa. 42.15. <hi>And when the great Whore comes to drink the Cup of Gods fury, which is already filled into the hands of the Saints of the moſt High, to pour out unto her,</hi> Rev. 12. I ſay, then ſhall ſhe knows that God hath ſpoken by me; and that I have herein declared the Truth according as I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from, and by the Spirit of the Lord. And thus much as to his Queries.</p>
                  <p>But then he ſpeaks of another Clear and Eaſie Way to find out the True Church, te try all Churches by the true Catechiſm, and ſee which of them all ſayes it truly, believes it rightly, &amp;c. and that which doth, is the true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, to try all Churches by their Doctrine, and Practice, and ſee which is moſt agreeable to the Principles, Doctrines, and Practice of the true Church in the Apoſtles dayes, is indeed a way that I do very well approve of; and if all controverſies betwixt you and us might be decided after this manner, (laying aſide all carnal Weapons, carnal Laws, Priſons, Fires, and the like, which hath been the Weapons that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath defended her ſelf with, for many Ages paſt, and doth at this day) I ſay then it would be indeed well, and we ſhall be very willing to engage with you with ſpiritual Weapons, bring the beſt you can form or find out; but for carnal Weapons, we are redeemed from them, and the Weapons of our warfare are ſpiritual; ſo I ſay, upon equal terms we ſhall be very willing to diſpute the matters with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93507:96"/>
you; that are in controverſie betwixt us, and they who are found, either you or us, in Doctrine, Life, and Practice, to be moſt agreeable to the true Church in the primitive times, ſhall be owned, and acknowledged to be the true Church now at this day. And they who are detected to be in the Steps, Practiſes, and Doctrines of them, whom the holy Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles teſtified againſt, ſhall be concluded to be the falſe Church now at this day: and upon theſe termes, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we ſhall be very ready and willing to joyn iſſue with you, at any time or place, that you with us ſhall agree upon.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That all the Schiſmaticks, Sectaries and Hereticks in the World, cannot truely ſay that Prayer that Chriſt taught his Diſciples, viz.</hi> Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven &amp;c. or, ſaid he, <hi>they are continually doing the Works of the Devil, and are his children, and conſequently cannot truly call God Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot call God Father, for ſhe is, and long hath been, doing the works of the Devil, the Murderer, as before proved; therefore ſhe is of her father the Devil, and cannot call God Father in Truth and in Righteouſneſs. Then <hi>A. S.</hi> rambles through ſeveral other particulars, in which he controverts with Sectaries, &amp;c. whoſe cauſe I am not concerned to plead, only this ſmall hint before I have given to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> one of thoſe Sects, who cannot ſpeak the fore-mentioned words truly, and ſo I ſhall leave the Sectaries, with whom <hi>A. S.</hi> controverts, to plead their own cauſe; for the thing that was chiefly in my heart, when I took in hand to write this brief Reply, was to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not to be the true Church; and the Chief Arguments by him Produced to prove
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93507:96"/>
her the True Church, I have already in brief anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>A. S.</hi> in his 6th Chapter, makes it his buſineſs to prove the Church to be the Judge of all controverſies in matters of faith, and ſaith, <hi>That not every man, nor human reaſon, nor the private Spirit, nor the Bible is this Judge;</hi> and to prove it, he quotes <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, That the Judgement of the true Church, of which Chriſt is Head, in matters of Faith, I do not deny; for being governed in all things by the Head Chriſt, <hi>(to whom all Judgment is committed,</hi> John 5.20.) the Judgment thereof muſt of neceſſity be Ture, (for the Strength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cannot Lye) and ought for to be ſubmitted unto by all; But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being not the True Church, (ſhe being not Governed by the inviſible Head, Chriſt, to whom all Judgment is committed, as before proved) Therefore ſhe is not Judge of Controverſies in matters of Faith. And the True Church, to whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that Heareth you, Heareth me,</hi> were ſuch as heard Chriſt, and in whom the Spirit of the Father ſpake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not hear Chriſt, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I ſhall prove; therefore they who hear the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do not hear Chriſt. But ſurely when <hi>A. S.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan this work of deciding Controverſies, he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that the Church was the only Judge in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and not every man, nor the private ſpirit; for had he conſidered that, (he being but a particular man) would not have undertaken the Churches work; as appears by the Title of his Book he hath, for he calls it, <hi>A brief Decider of all Controverſies in matters of Faith,</hi> which Book we have cauſe to judge is his own only
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93507:97"/>
work, and not the Churches; in which we find him condemning himſelf for the thing which he is doing; for, as appears by his aforeſaid Title, himſelf undertakes to decide controverſies; and in his 6th Chapter he affirmeth, 'That the Church is the only Judge, or decider of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies: But this is, that his confuſion may the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as it hath done in many other things, as may be ſeen in this ſmall Treatiſe; and ſurely, if the Pope have no better Servants then <hi>A. S.</hi> to do his work for him, he had better keep them idle, than to employ them in ſuch a work; for in the end they will bring more ſhame to him than they will honour; for ſuch like confuſions, and other abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have already made the very name of the Pope an ill favour to all true Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>And one thing more in <hi>A. S.</hi> his 6th Chapter, I cannot well omit to obſerve, where he ſaid, <q>The ſpirit inſpireth when he will, and you hear his voice, but cannot tell whence, from God or the Devil he doth come, or whither to Heaven or to Hell he doth go;</q> and then ſaith, <q>So is every one that is born of the ſpirit;</q> and to prove this, he quotes <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55. where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now conſider the blindneſs, and ignorance, or elſe the wilful wickedneſs, of <hi>A. S.</hi> who jumbles a deal of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together, blaſphemouſly wreſting of them to his own deſtruction, or at leaſt, to the deſtruction of his own work in hand, thinking thereby to blind the minds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with his good words, (mixed with blaſphemies) and fair ſpeeches, to deceive the hearts of the ſimple, as his Predeceſſors have done in the long night of Apoſtacy, which hath been over all Nations ſince the Apoſtles days. But its in vain for him to ſtrive to accompliſh his end, for the Day is dawned unto many, and there is an eye opened
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93507:97"/>
in many thouſands in this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> that gives them to ſee over, and beyond all this Babyloniſh or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed trumpery, and ſtuff, and have a feeling of that which was before <hi>Babylon</hi> was, and ſhall out-laſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> to the praiſe of God, and to the glory and honour of his Name, who is bleſſed for ever. Well,</p>
                  <p>Although it was ſo, that Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>You know not what ſpirit ye are of,</hi> yet conſider the time when he ſpake theſe words; was it not before they were born of the Spirit? (although called to be Apoſtles) for Chriſt ſaid unto them, <hi>you muſt be born again,</hi> John. 3.7, 8. <hi>and that he would ſend them the Spirit</hi> (of which he ſaid they muſt be born) <hi>which ſhall lead them into all Truth,</hi> John 16.13. and he did not ſay, as <hi>A. S.</hi> doth, that they ſhould not know whence (from God or the Devil) the Spirit came, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to Heaven or to Hell) it went: Oh, horrid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in <hi>A. S!</hi> who ſaith, ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit; as much as to ſay, that he that is born of the Spirits knows not whether he be from God, or the Devil; or whither he ſhall go, to Heaven or to Hell: Oh, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs indeed! Chriſt ſaid no ſuch things, as <hi>A. S.</hi> doth, although that bleſſed worthy ſaying of our Saviour and Lord Chriſt, was, and is very true, <hi>(viz.) Marvel not that I ſay unto you, that you muſt be born again; for the wind bloweth where it liſteth, and men hears the ſound thereof, but cannot tell from whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth;</hi> adding, <hi>even ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.7, 8. (Mark) they that were born of the Spirit, were unknown to the World; for ſaid the Apoſtle (after they were born again) <hi>the World knows us not.</hi> So, although they were in the World, and men ſaw them, yet the World knew them not, no more than they knew from whence the wind came, and wither it went, which they heard the ſound of;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93507:98"/>
and indeed ſo is the ſtate of the True Church in the World at this day.</p>
                  <p>And the Apoſtles did know from whence the Spirit came, and of what Spirit they were, after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Truth, and were born of it, for Chriſt told them, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. <hi>That he would Pray the Father, and he ſhould ſend them the Holy Ghoſt, the Conforter,</hi> John 16.7, 13. <hi>Which ſhould ABIDE with them for ever; and they did receive it, and were led by it into a Heavenly Habitation,</hi> Epheſ. 1.3. <hi>For they were made to ſit together in Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> So its hereby clear, that the Apoſtles knew from whence the Spirit came, and whither it led them; and its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo plain, that <hi>A. S.</hi> either wilfully or ſottiſhly wreſts the Words of Chriſt, and by his additious to them, would make them import another thing, than was intended by him, of purpoſe to divert People from being led by the Spirit of God, or to diſſwade them from adhering to the leadings of it, under pretence that they cannot tell whence, (from God or the Devil) it doth come, or whither (to Heaven or to Hell) it goeth, when indeed Chriſt's words in themſelves importeth quite another thing, as above ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let all mind and obey the Spirit of Truth, which will lead into all Truth, and condemn ſin in the Fleſh, and will lead out of all Unrighteouſneſs, and Errours, and Hereſies, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is full of, and that Spirit which condemns the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Whore, and all Sin and Unrighteouſneſs, that is the Spirit of God, and comes from God, through the Son of his love, who is the Light of the World, that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93507:98"/>
leadeth up unto God the Father, from whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, all who are Taught and Guided by it; but condemneth from God all who in Unbelief, or in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion do diſpight unto it, and diſobey the Motions thereof.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the matter concerning the Churches being Judge.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I find <hi>A. S.</hi> in the beginning of his ſeventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaying, <hi>Methinks I hear a</hi> Quaker <hi>whiſpering, The Light that is in thee is the Judge of all Controverſies, and the Law and Rule according to which thou muſt walk.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Yea, The People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do believe and ſay, That the Light which every man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with, is the Law and Rule according to which every man ought to walk, and is the Judge in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Matters of Faith; for (as before) <hi>All Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is committed unto the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. <hi>Who lighteth every man that cometh into the World;</hi> ſo all Judgment being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Light, that lighteth every man, the Light that is in every man muſt of neceſſity be the Judge of all Controverſies: And this I further add, That all who are Baptized into Chriſt, hath put on Chriſt, and all who are by one Spirit Baptized into one Body, (though they were ſometimes Darkneſs) are made Light in the Lord, and ſo they being in him, and he in them, are all one, even as Chriſt and the Father is one, and he that ſanctifieth, and they that are Sanctified, are all of one; by which its clear, that Chriſt in his Church, who is Light with him, is the onely Judge of all Controverſies: and indeed this ſupernatural Light is the true Touch-ſtone, by which all ſpitits may be tried, whether they be of God, or not; for, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever makes manifeſt,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93507:99"/>
is light, Epheſians</hi> 5.13. ſo that without this Touchſtone, none can try ſpirits, becauſe an evil ſpirit may ſpeak good words.</p>
                  <p>Again, Chriſt is in all things to be the Example of all Believers; <hi>and he lighteth every man that cometh into the World, John</hi> 1.9. ſo every man being enlightened with the light of his Spirit, who is to be our example in all things, it muſt of neceſſity be, that the Light that is in us is this Judge, and the Law and Rule according to which all ought to walk.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But then <hi>A. S.</hi> replyes, <hi>That the Light that is in thee tells thee, that thou muſt hear Chriſt, and Chriſt tells thee, that thou muſt hear the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Yea, the Light that is in us teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to hear Chriſt, who hath enlightened us, and alſo to hear his Church, with whom he dwells, and that hears him, and in whom his Spirit ſpeaks; ſo, as I ſaid before, I ſhall not go about to deny the Authority of the True Church; but the uſurped authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> I do deny; uſurp'd, I ſay, becauſe ſhe hath been, and here is, ſufficiently proved not to be the true Church (to whom Chriſt gives power and authority both to bind and to looſe) therefore her authority if uſurp'd, and ſhe is not to be heard, but to be turned away from.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>If you object, that the Spiritual judgeth all things; and the Spirituall is judged of no man.</hi> I anſwer, that the godly Spiritual judgeth all things, &amp;c. But I deny that you, or any other Sectaries in the World, is Godly Spiritual, for, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, they have not the Holy Ghoſt that are out of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93507:99"/>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> To which I ſay, that as <hi>A. S.</hi> hath confeſſed, <hi>That the ſpiritual man judgeth all things,</hi> its according to my own belief; but what doth this avail the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who as I have proved is not godly ſpiritual; but is ſenſual and deviliſh, and is not the true Church, but the Whore; for although, as he ſaith, The godly ſpiritual is judged of none; yet the Whore is judged of all who are godly ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and although <hi>A.S.</hi> denyeth, that the Quakers are godly ſpiritual, yet he is never able to prove his affirmation; for though they have not the holy Ghoſt who are out of the Church; yet it doth not follow, that they have it not who are out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> except ſhe could be proved to be the true Church.</p>
                  <p>The contrary whereof I have already proved; for the people called Quakers (though they are out of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> are led by that Spirit which teacheth them to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World, as thouſands of their Neighbours can bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; therefore the people called Quakers are godly Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>Again, That Prophet which is of God is godly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.9. and that Prophet which ſpeaketh a thing, and the thing come to paſs, that Prophet is of God; But the people called Quakers have propheſied ſeveral things, as to the late overturn'd Powers of this Nation<note n="*" place="margin">Witneſs the Book Intituled, Good Counſel and Advice Reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> (with divers other things) which accordingly came to paſs, (as to their ſorrow they were made to know) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are of God, and godly ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>A. S.</hi> again ſaid, If you ſay, <hi>Know ye not your ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93507:100"/>I anſwer, <hi>The true ſence and meaning of this place is this,</hi> &amp;c So here A. S. is again undertaking that which himſelf ſaith is the Churches work; for ſaith he in his eighth Chapter, the Church is the alone Interpreter of all Scriptures; and yet he himſelf, who is but a particular man, is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to give an interpretation or meaning, to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Scripture, by which it is plain, that he condemns himſelf in the things he is doing?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again Fifthly, he ſaith, <hi>That the Spirit of God ſaith, Hear the Church, but the ſpirit of the Devil contradicts, and ſaith, Hear not the Church, but Chriſt alone; for of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>its written, This is my beloved Son, him hear ye: behold the Devil pleads for Chriſt, of purpoſe to deceive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, That I think I need not ſay much to convince all that reads but <hi>A. S.</hi> his own words, that he is either groſly ignorant, or elſe abominably wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wicked; for who can believe that the Devil will plead for Chriſt, or perſwade people to hear Chriſt, and diſſwade them from hearing of the Church? certainly, if he would perſwade people to hear the greater, he would not diſſwade them from hearing the leſſer: And how can people poſſibly be deceived, that hears Chriſt and obeys him? I cannot believe that its the ſpirit of the Devil that perſwades people to hear Chriſt, but rather, that its the drawings of the Spirit of the Father, that invites them to come unto the Son, and to hear him, for Chriſt ſaid, <hi>None cometh unto me, except my Father, who hath ſent me draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>A. S.</hi> contrariwiſe (in effect) ſaith, <hi>That the Devil draws people to come unto Chriſt, and to hear him;</hi> By which he hath manifeſtly ſhewed, that he is of a contrary ſpirit unto Chriſt; Therefore <hi>A. S.</hi> is an Antichriſt, and one that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93507:100"/>
puts Light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light; againſt whom the woe is pronounced, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. And although <hi>A. S.</hi> ſo much pleads for the Church (whom I know all will hear, that hears Chriſt) yet upon ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I find its of purpoſe to deceive Chriſtians, and ſo he hath ſhewed himſelf as bad as the Devil he ſpeaks of, being found doing the ſame work, of which he ſeems to accuſe the Devil; for in his ſixth Chapter I find him (as afore declared) in effect perſwading people, <hi>Not to adhere to the motions of the Spirit of Chriſt, under pretence that they cannot tell whence (from God or the Devil) it comes, or whither to (Heaven or Hell) it goeth,</hi> &amp;c. And as above, he is again perſwading people, <hi>That its a dangerous thing to hear that Spirit that invites them to hear Chriſt;</hi> calling it the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, becauſe it doth not invite them to hear the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo. But I never read or heard before, that any ſpirit did invite people to hear Chriſt, but the Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and his Spirit ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, him hear ye,</hi> Mat. 17.5. Therefore that Spirit that invites people to hear the Son of God, is not the Devil, but the Spirit of the Father, and ought to be heard and obeyed by all.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, Again, <hi>S. A.</hi> affirmeth, that the Spirit of God ſaith, <hi>That Carpenters, Smiths, Maſons, and other Tradeſmen, muſt not meddle with Eccleſiaſtical things, as to Preach, or Teach,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the evil ſpirit affirmeth the quite contrary, by perſwading them they may all propheſie one by one. But alas then,</hi> ſaith, A. S. <hi>He deceiveth, for that place is underſtood of the real and True Prophets, of whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all the Devils in Hell cannot prove all Tradeſmen to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here <hi>A. S.</hi> ſeems to oppoſe that, which for my part I know none affirms; for who is there that ſaith all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93507:101"/>
Tradeſmen have the Spirit of Propheſie? I know none. Yet although all Tradeſmen have it not, it doth not therefore follow that no Tradeſmen have it; neither did I ever read, that the Spirit of God did forbid Tradeſmen to meddle with thoſe things, nor doth that Scripture which <hi>A. S.</hi> quotes confirm any ſuch thing which he affirmes, but rather the contrary: And we do read in the Scriptures of Truth, that Chriſt did call ſome of ſeveral Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to Teach the Way of God, and to Preach the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel; witneſs St <hi>Peter</hi> a Fiſher-man, St <hi>Paul</hi> a Tent-maker, with divers others that might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that though all Tradeſmen have not the Spirit of Propheſie, yet we ſee that ſome had, and they were not forbidden, but commanded to Preach and Teach; and therefore they who have the Teſtimony of Jeſus, which is the Spirit of Propheſie (although they be Tradeſmen) they may Preach and Teach according to the Gift thereof received; for the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Every one as he hath received the Gift of the Spirit, ſo let him adminiſter,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, And ſaith <hi>A. S.</hi> the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Women muſt not ſpeak in the Church; but the Devil ſaith they may. For the Scripture averreth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That your Sons and Daughters ſhall Propheſie; this Devil deceiveth the Women</hi>-Quakers. <hi>But alas, that Scripture was fulfilled in the Apoſtles, and in the true Propheteſſes in their times, as</hi> Anna, Luke 2.28. <hi>and now is in ſuch as have the True Spirit of Propheſie, which</hi> Quakers <hi>Wives and Daughters can never prove themſelves to have.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here <hi>A. S.</hi> hath confeſſed that there was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes in the Apoſtles dayes, and that there now is at this day alſo; and the Apoſtle ſpake of Women that were helpers with him in the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. So then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93507:101"/>
its undeniable that Women did ſpeak and Propheſie, and now may; though the Apoſtles did not Permit Buſie-bodies and Tattlers, to be asking Queſtions in the Church, but ſaid they ſhould ask their Husbands at Home.</p>
                  <p>So the thing diſputable is, whether or no <hi>Quakers</hi> Wives and Daughters have the true Spirit of Propheſie? concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I ſay this, The Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Propheſie, and many Wives and Daughters of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have received the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and knows the Life of Jeſus manifeſted in them, as by their fruits of Love, Meekneſs, Gentleneſs, Patience, Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, &amp;c. (which are fruits of the Spirit) doth appear unto thoſe who have a knowledg of them; Therefore they have the Spirit of Propheſie.</p>
                  <p>And further, ſeveral of the Wives and Daughters amongſt the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have Propheſied of the deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great Whore (the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) and when that comes to paſs, it will be thereby proved, that they have the true Spirit of Propheſie; and then ſhall every Tongue confeſs to it, and in the mean time let none ſpeak evil of the things they know not, leſt they be found fighters againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Again, <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the good Spirit ſaith, It is a Religious Act to Swear by God in a Juſt Cauſe; but the Evil-ſpirit contradicts; for its written, ſaith he,</hi> [Sware not at all.] <hi>Behold the Puritaniſm of this impure ſpirit; but alas, he deludeth; for God expreſly commands,</hi> Jer. 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt Swear the Lord liveth in Truth, in Judgment, and in juſtice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, although in the Law and Prophets, people were commanded to Swear in Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and to perform their Oaths to the Lord; yet
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93507:102"/>
Chriſt (the new Covnant, whom God promiſed ſhould not be according to the old) ſaith Sware not at all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32. and though <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were to be heard, under the miniſtration of the firſt Covenant, yet they ſaid when Chriſt the ſecond Covenant was come, people muſt hear him; for ſaid <hi>Moſes, a Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you like unto me, him ſhall ye hear,</hi> Deut. 18.15. And the Prophet ſaid, that Nation and people that will not ſerve thee, that Nation ſhall periſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.12. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid thou ſhalt perform thy Oath to the Lord, yet Chriſt that Prophet who is the end of that Law, (and whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid the people muſt hear, or elſe be cut off) he ſaid <hi>Sware not at all;</hi> and although the Prophet ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt Sware the Lord liveth,</hi> &amp;c. yet Chriſt who is the end of the Prophets (&amp; whom the Prophets ſaid people muſt ſerve, or elſe periſh, ſaith, <hi>Sware not at all;</hi> and although it may be alledged that the Angels ſwore, yet Chriſt the firſt born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many Brethren (to whom all the Angels muſt bow) ſaith, <hi>Sware not at all,</hi> and although it may be further alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God himſelf ſwore, and therefore its lawful for Chriſtians to Sware, yet God himſelf ſaid, concerning Chriſt, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him,</hi> Mat. 17.5. And this beloved Son of God, (whom all Chriſtians ought to hear) ſaith, <hi>Sware not at all.</hi> All which being rightly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſidered, it plainly appears, that Swearing by any Oath whatſoever, was forbidden by Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Law-giver unto all Chriſtians, and therefore it is not lawful for Chriſtians to Sware at all: And that ſpirit that tollerates Swearing or would ſet it up, as a Religious Act, is an Antichriſt ſpirit, becauſe it is againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And although the Apoſtle might, or did call the Lord to witneſs concerning the Truth which he ſpake, yet that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93507:102"/>
doth not prove that the Apoſtle ſwore, as <hi>A. S.</hi> affirmeth that he did, neither do we read that ever any of the Apoſtles did either propagate, or tollerate Swearing, ſince Chriſt forbid it; But contrariwiſe the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Above all things my Brethren, Swear not; neither by Heaven, nor by the Earth, neither by any other Oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, leſt you fall into condemnation:</hi> So that although <hi>A. S.</hi> would wreſt the words of Chriſt to perſwade people that his intent was they ſhould not Swear but in Truth and in Righteouſneſs, yet the words of Chriſt and the Apoſtle (whom all true Chriſtians are to hear) doth clearly import that their intent was, that people ſhould not Swear at all by any Oath whatſoever: But this Antichriſtian ſpirit which oppoſes the Doctrines and Commands of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, we have had large experience of, and we have oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen that it leads people to ſwear, and alſo to forſwear themſelves, both which are an <hi>Abomination</hi> to the Lord, and in the Tranſgreſſion againſt God and the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, and <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, the Apoſtle, ſaid <hi>ſalute one another, but the Devil ſaith, ſalute not one another, for Chriſt ſaith, he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Diſciples, bid them ſalute no man by the way,</hi> Luke 10.4. <hi>this Devil follows all</hi> Quakers, <hi>but alas, Chriſt's meaning there was, that none ſhould hinder them by the way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer here again <hi>A. S.</hi> goes about to make us believe, that the Commands of Chriſt are the Impoſitions of the Devil, or at leſt that the Devil ſtirs up people to keep the Commands of Chriſt; the firſt of which is Blaſphemy in the higheſt degree, and the ſecond is little leſs: for if the Devil would teach people to keep the Commands of Chriſt, then might they ſerve Chriſt and <hi>Belial:</hi> but as Chriſt ſaid, that cannot be. And indeed we do experimentally ſee &amp; find, that the Devil always oppoſeth the keeping of Chriſts Commands: As now in <hi>A.S. Who
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93507:103"/>
would diſwade them from it, under pretence that its the Devil that leads them to it: And as to his ſaying, this Devil follows all</hi> Quakers.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Its true; but alas its intentionally to deſtroy them; for it was ſaid to the Serpent in the beginning, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe his Head, and he ſhould bruiſe its Heel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And even ſo its now come to paſs, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the promiſed Seed, <hi>Gal</hi> 3.16. being become the Leader of his people, and the Angel of Gods preſent going before them, the Devil, as <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, comes after them, and follows them with his fiery darts of perſecution, and Serpent-like is ſnarling at the Heel: But bleſſed be the Lord, he that goes before them, and is in them, is greater and mightier then the Devil that follows them, and he hath been their Preſerver hitherto, and I doubt not, but he will unto the end perſerve all who truſt in him.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning Chriſts words, there needs no meaning to be given to them, for he meant as he ſpoke, but if they did according to <hi>A. S</hi>'s own concluſion, he is not the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the Church; Therefore <hi>(A.S.</hi> being not the Church, but a particular man) according to his own Argument, his interpretation is not to be heeded. Again he ſaith, <hi>Every man is not the Interpreter,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>Every man is a Lyar:</hi> And indeed he hath conformed unto us, that himſelf is a Lyar, becauſe he hath belyed the intent of Chriſts words aforeſaid, by giving his meaning to them.</p>
                  <p>Then ſaith <hi>A. S. Yet theſe deluded Souls think that this their deluding Spirit is of God; and why forſooth, becauſe it reprehends them of ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and did not</hi> Judas <hi>his ſpirit rebuke him of ſin, and notwithſtanding induce him to deſperation, and to hang himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here <hi>A. S.</hi> is again putting Light for darkneſs, or calling the Spirit of Truth a deluding Spirit; for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93507:103"/>
is not that the Spirit of Truth that reproves the World of ſin, <hi>John</hi> 16.7, 8. Did not Chriſt ſay, that he would ſend the Comforter, that ſhould reprove the World of ſin, and we never read of any other Spirit that did reprove ſin, but the Spirit of Truth, which <hi>A. S.</hi> (blaſphemouſly) calls a deluding Spirit; neither did I ever read, that a deluding Spirit was the Comforter, which that Spirit that reproves for ſin is, as Chriſt ſaid. And again, is it not clear that <hi>A. S.</hi> puts Light for darkneſs, in calling that a deluding Spirit, which reproves ſin; for the Apoſtle ſaid, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are reproved, are made manifeſt by the Light, for whatſoever makes manifeſt is Light, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13. and the deluding ſpirit is darkneſs it ſelf; ſo that hereby it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appears, that <hi>A. S.</hi> cannot diſcern betwixt Light and darkneſs, ſo is a miſerable Blind-Guide indeed. And though the Spirit of Truth did rebuke <hi>Judas</hi> for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, doth it therefore follow that it was the ſame that led him to hang himſelf; no, this is great Ignorance in <hi>A. S.</hi> to affirm; for he might as well have ſaid, That the ſame Spirit that led him to betray his Maſter, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rebuke him for it; but then his Ignorance would have ſomewhat more plainly appeared: But it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſame ſpirit which led <hi>Judas</hi> into that preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act, as to betray his Maſter, that afterwards led him to deſperation, and to hang himſelf; and that Spirit which let him ſee his wickedneſs which he had done, and rebuked him for it, was Light; <hi>For whatſoever makes manifeſt is Light,</hi> Eph. 5.13.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, then laſtly he ſaith, <hi>Thus far have we digreſſed for the Converſion of</hi> Quakers, &amp;c</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I ſay, that if he hath no better way to convert <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor no better Arguments to produce in order to their Converſion, then what he hath made uſe of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93507:104"/>
in his pretended reconſiler of Religions, he were better be ſilent and ſave his Labour, for I cannot believe that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch Books will ever convert (or rather divert) one <hi>Quaker,</hi> nay, nor convince them neither, except it be of his own groſs Ignorance or wilful wickedneſs, of which there is enough appears, as before manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>Thus having briefly anſwered the moſt remarkable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments produced by <hi>A. S.</hi> to prove the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the true Church, and alſo the ſeveral particulars, by which he endeavoured to render the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as a people led by a deluding Spirit: I find the reſt of his Book conſiſts of divers Arguments, in which he controverts with Sectaries, and their Bibles, and Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe cauſe (as aforeſaid) I am not ingaged in, therefore it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me to anſwer his Charges againſt them, but ſhall leave them to anſwer for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Although there are indeed many things contained in the remaining part of his Book, from which I might lay open much of the deceit and Ignorance of <hi>A. S.</hi> and the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> But the generality of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being alreadly ſo fully ſatisfied concerning her: and the confuſion and ignorance of <hi>A. S.</hi> alſo being herein ſo fully manifeſted already; I look upon it as ſuperfluous at preſent to inlarge on this account; and indeed if never a word had been ſaid, the very fruits brought forth by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the view of all Nations, are enough to foreware them of adhering to her, for can a man touch Pitch and not be defiled.</p>

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93507:104"/>Firſt, to which I anſwer; that is the true Church, (and no other (whoſe fruits make manifeſt that they are govern'd by the inviſible head Chriſt, and that continue in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and that are found in the ſame order, or diſcipline in their Aſſemblies, that the true Church was in the primitive times; and that have the ſame way of ordaining Miniſters, that the true Church had; and that lives ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent World, as the true Church did; But the people called <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> are ſuch as hereafter I ſhall prove; Therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers</hi> are the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is manifeſt by the fruits of the people call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they are governed by the inviſible Head Chriſt; for Chriſt commands his Followers, not to ſwear at all, which command the aforeſaid people obſerve and keep, as this Nation of <hi>England</hi> full well knows.</p>
                  <p>Again, Chriſt came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them; and commanded his Followers to love their Enemies; And it is manifeſt that the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> have the mind of Chriſt becauſe they ſeek not the deſtruction of any, but the preſervation and good of all, and that they love even their Enemies, who hate, and perſecute them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ready to aſſiſt, or be helpfull to them upon all occaſions, or opportunities, in any thing that may tend to their preſent and future well-being; therefore, they are governed by the inviſible Head Chriſt: Again, Chriſt commanded ſaying, <hi>whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do ye unto them,</hi> Mat. 7.12. which command the aforeſaid people obſerve and keep, as thouſands can bear witneſs for them; Therefore they are governed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Head Chriſt, and are the True Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Again the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> continue in the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for Chriſt preacht
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93507:105"/>
the Doctrine of Perfection, ſaying, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> Math. 5.48. And the Apoſtle preacht the ſame Doctrine: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. and Laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every man perfect in Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved gifts for that very work, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12. And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers</hi> do preach the ſame Doctrine of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Labour in the Power and Spirit of the Lord, to preſent people perfect in Chriſt, as the Apoſtles did, as thouſands can bear Teſtimony; by which it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they continue in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; and therefore they are the true Church.</p>
                  <p>But this Chriſtian Doctrine is oppoſed by all the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Miniſters thoughout the whole <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> or by all <hi>Babylons</hi> Merchants in every part of her Teritories, who ignorantly produce many <hi>good words</hi> to oppoſe this <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As Firſt, they urge <hi>Solomons</hi> words <hi>(viz) There is not a juſt man upon the Earth that doth good, and ſinneth not;</hi> Therefore ſay they, people cannot be perfect; But alas, they do not diſcern the ſigns of the times, neither do they conſider the time and ſeaſon when theſe words were ſpoken; for at that time all were gone out of the Way, and there was none that did good, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 14.3. and they had forſaken the Lord, and knew not ſo much of him, as the Oxe did of his Owner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. and were in the tranſgreſſion of Gods Covenant which he made with their Fathers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. ſo that although there were none without ſin at that time; yet it doth not follow the people can never be free from ſin, no more then their being then ignorant of God, doth argue, that people ſhould never come to the knowledg of him; the contrary of both which may be eaſily proved by plain Scripture; for at that time when <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſtrangers unto God, and were all gone out of the way, and none amongſt them did good, &amp;c. even then did God promiſe that the day ſhould come in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93507:105"/>
which he would make a new Covenant with the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (who were in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, of the firſt Covenant <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31.) and that he would finiſh tranſgreſſion, and make an end of ſin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 24. who had hid his face from them (and by which they were made Strangers to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2.) and that he would remember their Iniquities no more, and that they <hi>ſhould all know him from the leaſt, to the greateſt, Jer.</hi> 31.34. by which it is evident, that (although in the Prophets days, they were all in tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had not the Knowledge of God) the purpoſe of God was to bring them into a better ſtate, which the true <hi>Church</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes were Witneſſes of, (for the Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.46. God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us could not be made perfect,) and although ſome of them had been Idolators, and had lived in the pollutions of the World, yet they were waſhed and clenſed, yea, and juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11. and ſo though they were ſometimes ignorant of God, yet God cauſed the Light to ſhine out of darkneſs in their hearts, to give them the Light of the Knowledge of Gods Glory in the face of Chriſt, who dwelt in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. ſo that both ſin and ignorance, was done away in them though the power and coming of the Lord Jeſus, and ſo they did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain in their ſin, but were freed from them, as the Apoſtle teſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 18. &amp; 1.2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But then Antichriſt's Mimiſters ſaith, That if they were free from ſin, why did the Apoſtle ſay; That if we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves and the Truth is not in us, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer he did not ſay ſo becauſe people could not be made free from ſin, but he ſaid ſo that they might not ſin, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.1. and conſider who they were that he then
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93507:106"/>
wrote to; for he ſometimes wrote to Children, and ſomtimes to Young-men, and ſometimes to Fathers in the truth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. But when be ſpake thoſe words <hi>(viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) If we ſay we have no ſin,</hi> &amp;c. he then ſpake to Children; for ſaid he, <hi>my little Children, theſe things I write unto you, that you ſin not,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. Now if they had been already perfect, or fully fully freed from ſin, then had they attained to the mans ſtate, which the Apoſtle laboured to bring them to, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. But they having not attained to that ſtate, he would not have them to deceive themſelves, (nor to think more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of themſelves then they ought to think, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.) which Children in underſtanding are ſubject to do, but with theſe little Children the Apoſtle <hi>Travelled in birth, that Chriſt might be formed in them, Gal.</hi> 4.19. (who is <hi>the one offering that perfects for ever, all them that are ſanctified, Heb.</hi> 10.14.) and he laboured to build them up in the holy Faith which gives Victory through Chriſt, that ſo they might be borne up to a mans ſtate, for ſaid He, he that is born of God doth not ſin, John 3.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But then, it may be ſome will object, that the Apoſtle ſpake not only of Children, but of himſelf alſo, ſaying, If we ſay, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, that although the Apoſtle numbred himſelf with them, yet that doth not argue, that he was in their ſtate, or that he was not ſet free from ſin, no more then <hi>James</hi> his numbring himſelf amongſt the ſcattered Jews, (ſaying, <hi>with the ſame mouth curſe we men &amp;c.</hi> Jam. 1.9) doth argue that he was one of them that did curſe men, for its evident that the Apoſtle became as weak, to them that were weak, and to the ſtrong, as ſtrong, and to them that were under the Law, as under the Law, and to them that were without the Law, as without the Law, though not without Law to God, and <hi>became all things unto all, that he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93507:106"/>
thereby might gain ſome;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20, 21, 22. ſo although he did condeſcend to them that were weak, as Children or Babes in Chriſt, as to number himſelf amongſt them, for the gaining of them to a farther ſtate, yet that doth not at all argue, that he was, as they were, for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſaid, <hi>that he was ſet free from the Law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. all which being rightly weighed, it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that perfection or freedom from ſin, is attainable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which by the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> is preached and continued in, as before aſſerted, therefore they are the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, The Order and Diſcipline of the true Church in the Apoſtles time, was, That the Prophets might ſpeak two or three, and the reſt might judge; and if any thing was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to another that ſate by, he might ſpeak, and the firſt was to hold his peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29, 30. and the ſame order the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> have in their Aſſemblies, as is known to thouſands, by which it appears that they are the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, The Miniſters of Chriſt in the true Church in the primitive times (who turned people from darkneſs to light, and from Satans power, to the Power of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1.) were Ordained and made Miniſters, not of man, nor by man, nor of the letter, but of the Spirit, by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. and ſo are the Miniſters amongſt the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> made Miniſters of the Spirit, by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, as the effects of their miniſtry doth teſtifie; for many are turned from darkneſs to light, and from iniquity to righteouſneſs, and the ſpirits in Priſon is by them miniſtred unto, and the dead are raiſed unto life, and the Captives are ſet at Liberty, as thouſands can and muſt bear witneſs; Therefore the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> are the true Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:93507:107"/>Sixthly, The true Church in the primitive times, was taught by the Grace of God, <hi>that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, they ſhould live ſoberly and righteouſly, and goodly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. and the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> being taught by the ſame ſpirit of Grace, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ungodlineſs, and wordly luſts (as many in this Nation well knows) and doth live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, as thouſands can teſtifie; Therefore the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> are the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus I might produce many more Arguments to prove the aforeſaid people to be the Church of true Chriſtians, but much of this kind hath been by ſeveral of them already written; wherefore, I ſhall not inlarge at preſent; but for any that ſhall deſire any farther ſatisfaction, let them come to the Aſſemblies of the aforeſaid people, and hear their Doctrines, and behold their Diſcipline, &amp;c. and, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Try all things, and hold faſt that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.21.</p>

                  <p>FOraſmuch as it hath pleaſed God Almighty (after the long Night of woful groſs Darkneſs, Apoſtacy and Ignorance, which hath been over the Nations, amongſt thoſe who have had a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity) again to make known and manifeſt, the true, new, and living way which leads unto Life Eternal, even by and through the Revelation and Operation of his Eternal Power, and Word of Life, in the hearts of a Remnant,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93507:111"/>
whom (in this our day) he firſt reached unto and viſited, and raiſed up to be Witneſſes thereof; that by them it might be born Teſtimony unto, amongſt thoſe who were ſtrangers to it, and that thirſted after it, that ſo thereby they alſo might receive the manifeſtation and knowledge thereof, for want of which many periſh, and are ſtrangers to the way of Life; having only (at beſt) a Form of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without the Power: In which dead Forms, or outſide empty Profeſſions, ſome are at eaſe and reſt, as though they were in the true Heaven that ſhould never paſs away, and ſome are at reſt and at eaſe without any profeſſion, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in all uncleanneſs, unrighteouſneſs, and abomination; and ſome cannot find reſt in either. The faithful and true Witneſs of God being awakened in their Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which takes the falſe peace from them, and lets them ſee the emptineſs of all outſide profeſſions, which are without Life and Power, and alſo the Abominations, and vanities of the World, and makes ſin exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them: And by this true and faithful Witneſs are deſires, and breathings, and pantings begotten in their hearts after the Knowledge of God and Chriſt, after fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and acquaintance with the Father and the Son; which deſire cannot be ſatisfied without the Knowledge and enjoyment of the Preſence of the Lord, and of the Light of his Countenance. And for this cauſe many run to and fro, and wander like Sheep gone aſtray from the true Shepherds Fold, and are wearying themſelves upon the barren Mountains, in vain looking thereunto for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſeeking the Living amongſt the Dead, and ſo ſpend their labour for that which doth not ſatisfie. And in theſe ſeveral ſtates and conditions aforeſaid, the whole Chriſtian World lieth, who are not turned to the Light and Spirit of Jeſus in themſelves; and true reſt and ſalvation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93507:111"/>
cannot be found by them, until they return to the Light and Power of the Spirit of God in their own hearts, which is that whereby a diſlike of ſin is begotten in them, and alſo deſires after Life and Salvation; and Freedom from ſin is thereby begotten; and that is it alone which can anſwer every deſire, which is begotten by its ſelf. Well,</p>
                  <p>But when it pleaſed the Lord to reveal the Son of his Love, and to make known his eternal Power (in theſe latter dayes) for the rending of the Vail of Darkneſs that had long been over the heart, by which he cauſed the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, which gives the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his own Glory; he did not then give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and manifeſtation thereof unto all People, but he choſe certain Witneſſes, whom he raiſed up to declare of the manifeſtation of this Power, and to preach the Word of Life nigh, in the Heart and in Mouth; and he furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with Armour of Righteouſneſs, and with all ſpiritual Weapons; which were mighty through him, to break down the ſtrong holds of Iniquity, and the ſpiritual wickedneſſes that were in the high places; and impowred them as Inſtruments in his hand to turn many from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Light, that the Salvation of God they might come to ſee; and the Work of God greatly proſpered in their hands; and multitudes were brought to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Truth, to the ſaving of their Souls: and though they met with great oppoſition, and perſecutions, by the Emiſſaries of Sathan, even in all Quarters where they came; yet that was not prevalent to hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of that Work whereunto they were called of God; but it ſtill proſpered, and doth ſtill proſper, to the ſpreading of the unchangeable Truth abroad, even as is ſeen at this day.</p>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:93507:112"/>And of this number whom God Almighty at the firſt raiſed up by his Power for this Work aforeſaid, the late deceaſed <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> was one, concerning whom the chief occaſion of this my preſent writing is; that ſo a Teſtimony concerning him, and of what the Lord did by, and through him, may remain upon Record for Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to come; and that this preſent Generation of the Juſt, may ſee and hear his laſt Teſtimony, which proceeded from his own mouth a little before his departure out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and I doubt not, but thereby the Conſolation and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Comfort of the Houſhold of Faith will be added unto.</p>
                  <p>And, for theſe Cauſes, I could not well reſt ſatisfied in my ſpirit without taking in hand to publiſh theſe things; though I well know that there are many living Witneſſes that knew the Life, Labours, and Travels of the ſaid <hi>R.

willing, in obedience to the Power of God, to become a Fool to the World, and to be ſtript and emptied of his own wiſdom and knowledge, (which ſtood in the ſtate faln from God and his Power) and to ſuffer the loſs of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputation and favour, and the pleaſures and delights thereof, that he might win Chriſt Jeſus, and be found his Servant, clothed with the Righteouſneſs of Faith, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, beyond all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom and honour whatſoever; and his Sufferings for the ſake of Chriſt, beyond all worldly reputation; and ſo great was the change that was wrought it him, that he became a wonder amongſt many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Word of God and his Power was great and mighty in him, and through him; in which he was ſent forth by the Lord (who had manifeſted himſelf unto him) to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel to the Poor, and to declare of that great Power of God, of which he was made a Witneſs, and of the Effects of its operation; and ſo powerfull was his Meſſage and Teſtimony, that many were begotten into a firm belief thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and believing the Report, were turned from Darkneſs to the Light of Jeſus, with which they were enlightned, and from Sathans power unto the Power of God, which wrought mightily in their hearts, to the changing of their minds and affections from things that are below, towards things that are above all that is fading and corruptible, and to the bringing of Life and Immortality to light in them: And although they were atttended with many foul temptations, becauſe of their obedience to the Truth and Light of the Spirit of Grace, and brought in many diſtreſſes in their paſſage from Death unto Life, yet was he ſo experienced in the Depths and Subtilties of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and alſo in the Dealings and Goodneſs of God in ſuch conditions and eſtates, that he had obtained the

tongue of the Learned, and could (as oft times he did) ſpeak words in Seaſon, to the ſtrengthning of the weak, and refreſhing of the weary; and to the reviving of that which was near ready to faint: So that he was in the Lords Hand, even as a Father to the fatherleſs, and as eyes to the Blind, and feet to the lame; and the eye that truly ſaw him, bleſſed hm; and the ear that heard him, gave witneſs unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for through the Power of God which enabled him, he delivered the Poor and the needy, and built up many (that believed) in their moſt precious Faith, and confirmed them therein: And went about from place to place, through the Land of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, turning many from Darkneſs to Light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Churches, and doing good: And his Service was very great for the Lord in his day; for he was ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Heavenly Wiſdom and Underſtanding through the Grace of God; and alſo ſo ſeaſoned thereby, that his Patience, Meekneſs, and Humility exceeded many: And although God had ſo endued him with Heavenly Vertues and Abilities exceeding many, yet was he not pufft up therewith, neither ſought to exerciſe Lordſhip over thoſe that were weaker and younger then himſelf, but gave place unto any that had the leaſt Gift of God to exerciſe; ſo that through the Spirit of Meekneſs and Humility, with which he was adorned, he was exceeding lovely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and the hearts and ſouls of many were affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who in ſimplicity thirſted after Righteouſneſs, and ſuch waited for him, as for the Rain, upon whom his Doctrine ſo dropped: Yet nevertheleſs he was terrible to the Worker of Iniquity; and the Sword of his Mouth was very ſharp, for the Word of God was therein; and when he had to do with any who oppoſed the Truth and Way of Life and Salvation, which we profeſs and walk in (as oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93507:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had) his Weapon was very ſharp to them, and they were not able to reſiſt the Wiſdom of the Spirit by which he ſpoke; for thereby he confounded their wiſdom, and broke their Weapons in pieces; ſo that they were oft ready to Blaſpheme God, becauſe of the plague that it was to them; and a Conqueror he was over the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, againſt whom he made War in Righteouſneſs, in and though the Power of the Lamb, in whoſe Spirit he finiſhed his Teſtimony and Courſe in the Faith.</p>
                  <p>And as the Enemies of the Truth of God were many, and in divers ſhapes, that this valiant Souldiers of the Lamb had to encounter withal, ſo he was alwayes furniſhed with Armor and Weapons, fit for the Work and Service in which he was exerciſed, by which he was enabled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with, and Conquer all: But at laſt, that his Armor and Weapons might be proved to be ſufficient to encount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the Enemy of Truth, in all kind of Appearances and Transformations, it was his lot with me, and divers others of the Servants of the Lord, to be engaged againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Truth, who had transformed himſelf into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an Angel of Light, and under a ſeeming pretence of appearing on the behalf of God and his Cauſe, &amp;c. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Formality and Traditions, begun ſtrongly to oppoſe the Truth of God, and the Miniſtry thereof in and through his Servants and Meſſengers (who have approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the Miniſters of God, and as his Embaſſadors) and to cry againſt our Aſſemblies and manner of Worſhip, and our Exerciſe therein, (as only Formal;) in which we have always found the glorious Preſence, Power and Majeſty of the Lord amongſt us, refreſhing, comforting and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, even according as our Hearts &amp; Souls, can or could deſire; ſo that we were engaged to juſtifie the Lord, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that gainſaying ſpirit of deluſion, by which many
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93507:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were beguiled &amp; led away after Satan, to their hurt: And in our Teſtimony for the Lord, and againſt that ſelf-ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting gainſaying Spirit, the Power of the Lord did greatly accompany and aſſiſt us, and was as greatly with us, as in any ſervice that he had called us unto; <hi>The ſincere and upright in heart (who have kept their firſt Love, and their firſt Faith) are Witneſſes of it;</hi> and how in Love we laboured for the reſtoration of thoſe who were beguiled through the craft of the Enemy; and for the preſervation of thoſe who hitherto have eſcaped his Snare, that is well known to many witneſſes. But if none were ſenſible of it, the Lord he knows, and is Witneſs, that in ſincerity of heart (in the Name of the Lord) towards God and his People we were exerciſed; and in our Labour and Travel for them, the Bleſſings of the Lord and his Peace, and the comfort of his Spirit, did poſſeſs and fill our hearts beyond the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the World, although many, towards whom we were ſo in love exerciſed, could not believe, but ſome withſtood our Teſtimony, and kicked againſt it in their hearts, and reſiſted the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, to the grief and ſorrow of our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it pleaſed the Lord, in Love, Mercy and good Will to his Servant, my <hi>dear Brother R.

of the dealing of the Lord therein; by which they have hardned themſelves, inſtead of being humbled through that which was ordered of God for their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good; and if poſſible that ſuch may yet ſee, and turn to the flock of the Companions of Chriſt: And alſo that the flocks who are (and have remained) in the true Fold may be refreſhed thereby, I ſhall here inſert the <hi>Laſt Teſtimony</hi> of the aforeſaid <hi>R.

Whoſe words were as followeth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Friends, God hath been mightily with me, and hath ſtood by me at this time, and his Power and preſence hath accompanied me all along, though ſome think that I am under a Cloud for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but God hath appeared for the owning of our Teſtimony, and hath broken in upon me as a flood, and I am filled with his Love, more than I am able to expreſs; and God is really appeared for us. If God himſelf had come down and ſpoken as a man, he could not have ſpoke more clearer to us than he hath done, by the many Teſtimonies from Heaven in his People concerning this thing. Therefore I beſeech you Friends, here of this City of</hi> London, <hi>(whether I live or dye) be you faithful to your Teſtimony which God hath committed to you, and as it ariſeth in your hearts, be faithful to the Lord therein.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>After which he was ſilent for a little ſeaſon, and then his Mouth was again opened in the Name and Power of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93507:115"/>
the Lord, even as before, and he ſpake very preciouſly unto Friends concerning the things before mentioned, teſtifying of the greatneſs of the Love and Power of God, of which he was made partaker, and which he then felt; and of the preciouſneſs of the Truth, which he had with us born witneſs of; and exhorted them to faithfulneſs and ſtedfaſtneſs therein, and to ſingleneſs, that nothing might be ſuffered to creep in of another nature to intermix there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſaying, <hi>No Linſy-woolſy Garment muſt be worn,</hi> &amp;c. with much more to that effect, which cannot be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. And having thus given his laſt Teſtimony, as a Seal unto all the former Teſtimonies which he had given for the Lord, and on his behalf, in about two or three Hours time after, being filled with the Peace and Love of God beyond declaring, (as himſelf ſignified) he departed this Life, even like a Lamb, and Slept with his Fathers and Brethren, and is entred into everlaſting reſt with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And this may ſerve alſo as a ſufficient Teſtimony, to ſtop the Mouths of all who vaunt themſelves in his death, as though he had been taken away in Judgment and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Lord, becauſe of his appearing on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of God againſt that Antichriſtian ſpirit of oppoſition, which contends againſt our Meetings, and Preaching, and the manner of our exerciſe in the Worſhip of God, as Formal, &amp;c. And let ſuch know, that if his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved prove a Judgment unto any, it will be to them, who rejected the Mercies of God by him tendred to them, and have thereby hardned themſelves againſt the Lord and his Servants, and have made a wrong application of the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord with his Servant, even as thoſe who know not the purpoſe of God therein; and ſo have ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not to be the Friends of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93507:115"/>
whom God did not hide the thing that he intended; but let ſuch yet repent, if a place can be found for them.</p>
                  <p>And ſo let all my dear friends every where, who believe in the Light of Jeſus, and who have taſted of the Love, Goodneſs, and Power of God, dwell in the ſence and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Love and Power, and let nothing divert or turn aſide the minds of any from perſevering in that pure holy way of Life, which they are called to walk in, and in which the daily renewings of the peace and good will of God is witneſſed; neither let any be ſlack or remiſs, in performing that ancient, godly, Chriſtian practice of Aſſembling your ſelves together in the Name and Fear of the Lord, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ye know the exceeding benefit and advantage that ye have received thereby, becauſe of the Lords Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance amongſt us, who, acording to his Promiſe hath not failed us unto this day; but his Name and Power hath been great amongſt us, and ſtill is, opening the myſteries of his Kingdom, and revealing of the vertue of his Life in our Hearts and Souls, by his own Spirit, to our great refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and comfort; ſo that we have not at any time been <hi>ſent empty away,</hi> who have in ſincerity <hi>thirſted after him,</hi> and in faithfulneſs <hi>waited for his Appearance;</hi> which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to encourage all to perſevere in that godly practiſe of meeting together with all integrity, without wavering. And foraſmuch as our aſſembling together at this day, is the great thing that the Enemy of Truth ſtrikes at in all his Inſtruments of all kinds, in which he appears againſt us; it behoves all to ſtand and be faithful therein; that the Cauſe of God may not be betrayed by any, through their declining from that godly Practice and duty, that the Enemy may not be encouraged thereby to vaunt againſt the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that are faithful, to oppoſe them therein alſo; but rather, through your faithfulneſs and ſtability, the enemy
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93507:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be diſcouraged in his Enterpriſes, and put to flight, that <hi>you</hi> may be Conquerors over him, and may tread Satan under foot, and may reign with the Lamb for ever.</p>
                  <p>And my Friends, conſider the faithfulneſs of many of the Servants of the Lord, who loved not their lives unto death, who are gone before, who preached and made known the Truth and way of Life to <hi>you,</hi> how they laboured and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt <hi>you,</hi> in the Name and Strength of the Lord, to beget <hi>you</hi> unto God, and to build <hi>you</hi> up in the moſt pretious Faith; and how they exhorted <hi>you</hi> time after time to that godly practice, of Aſſembling together, and how they gave Example and Preſident therein as well as Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Nay, have not divers of them laid down their Lives (not counting them dear to them) for that very Practice of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling together? Yea, certainly they have ſo; ſome in Priſons, and ſome otherwiſe. Oh therefore my Friends, this Duty of Aſſembling together, ought not to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nay, hath not the preſent Liberty that we do enjoy, in our meeting together, coſt the Lives of many? was it not with the blood of many (of them that bore the ſame Teſtimony which we bare) that this preſent Liberty hath been purchaſed? and ought not this Liberty then to be prized, and made a right Uſe of; I am jealous with a godly Jealouſie, that all who are concerned, do not rightly weigh, ponder, and conſider theſe things; but I deſire all to conſider it, and let not that Teſtimony fall (by the negligence of any) which hath been ſealed with the Lives of ſo many of Gods Servants and Meſſengers, whoſe Knowledge and Underſtanding in the Way and Myſteries of God, was not inferiour unto any that are left behind,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93507:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and yet they chearfully offered up their All for that Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſake.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, my Friends, be diligent and faithful to the Lord, walking in his Covenant of Life, which will be a true Guide unto <hi>you,</hi> and an Inſtructor, and will keep <hi>your</hi> Deſires freſh towards the Lord, and <hi>your</hi> Love one towards another; ſo that <hi>you</hi> will be conſtrained to Come together, and to wait together upon the Lord, to receive refreſhment from his preſence, which <hi>you</hi> will ſee and feel in the middeſt of <hi>you,</hi> as <hi>your</hi> hearts are kept in his Fear; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into conſultation with Fleſh and Blood, nor into reaſonings which will ſay, <hi>Thou needeſt not go to Meetings, becauſe thy Teacher is preſent in all places,</hi> and ſo will draw thee into negligence of meeting with the Children of Light; for if thou gave heed unto ſuch reaſonings, thou wilt ſoon find, thy Love will wax cold towards the People of God, and thou wilt loſe the ſence of the Teachings of the Lord, who is preſent in all places; for although he be in all places preſent, yet hath he ordained and appointed, that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould Aſſemble themſelves together to wait upon him, and to worſhip him, and hath given the promiſe of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence unto ſuch that do ſo. But if any draw back from anſwering his requirings, <hi>his Soul will have no pleaſure in them:</hi> and ſuch will dye as to God, and will become as dry and withered Branches, and their Love will decay, and wax cold, and they will not have a ſight, nor a ſenſe of the Omnipreſence of the <hi>Lord,</hi> nor of his <hi>Teachings,</hi> though they may talk of it, as multitudes do at this day, who are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrangers thereunto, further than by hear ſay.</p>
                  <p>And therefore once more I ſay unto <hi>you</hi> all, Be faithful to the Lord in <hi>your</hi> ſeveral meaſures and ſtations, where the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſet <hi>you,</hi> and be diligent in that godly Practice

                  <p>So when he had thus exerciſed me with his Judgments, and filled my heart with his tender Mercies, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it with his Loving-kindneſs, ſo that the <hi>Way of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> was delightful unto me, and my life was not dear unto me for his ſake; <hi>then he ſpake unto me, ſaying,</hi> Thou muſt be my Servant to bring again the diſperſed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. with much more, which I judge is not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent here to be expreſſed; So to his ſervice I gave up my life truly, and whatſoever I had, I accounted not dear for his ſake; for he gave me the promiſe of his good preſence, that it ſhould never leave me, nor forſake me, but that he would accompany me therewith: And he is faithful, and keepeth Covenant, and performs his word unto his Servant; For he hath carried me through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countries in which I was a Stranger, and from one Nation to another People he hath led me; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through many People of divers and ſtrange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; and his good preſence never departed from me ſince I left the Land of my nativity; but he is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

                  <p>THat <hi>which was in the beginning, before the World was, and is now made manifeſt, which we have ſeen,</hi> and which we have taſted of, and which our hands have handled <hi>of the Word of Life;</hi> and that which is revealed to us in ſecret of the Spirit of the Lord, that do we declare openly, even that which we are eye Witneſſes of; For the Word hath took fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we have beheld his glory, <hi>as the glory of the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, full of Grace and Truth:</hi> And this is he who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Spirit, and made manifeſt for this end, that the works of the Devil might be deſtroyed; and that by and through him, the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; for want of whoſe knowledge the people periſh; and many (in divers parts of the World, as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) are in great perplexity and ſome even at their wits end, becauſe of the diſtractions, and many cries that are in the World, ſome crying this is the way, and other ſome, that is the way; and all of them from the Light of the Son of God in their own hearts and Conſciences, which leads in the way of Life and Peace (all who are guided by it) and out of all confuſion and deſtruction about Religion, and Church-Ordinance, and worſhip, and ſuch things, about which the World is in heaps and confuſion; and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing wayes and worſhips in their own fallen wiſdom, and would compel all to conform thereunto, (and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93507:123"/>
ought to be left unto the Lord, to be exerciſed by his Power in matters of Worſhip and Obedience towards him; and his Prerogative is to Rule there; So that people muſt either diſobey God, or the Laws of corrupt fallen Man; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is better, judge ye.</p>
                  <p>And this is ſad to ſee and conſider; becauſe there hath been for ſo many Years by paſt, ſo much preaching, and ſo much profeſſion of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the like, and that by men of all Profeſſions, as they have come into Authority one after another; and many and ſeeming fair Promiſes have been made by them all, <hi>that free Liberty of Conſcience (in things relating to God) ſhould be granted and allowed to people of all ſorts:</hi> for the breach of which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements (with many other) divers have already been rooted out, and overturned; and yet thereby men have not taken warning (though beſides, warnings have oft been given them in render love) to perform their Promiſes and Engagements in theſe things, and all other, though much conſiſteth therein as to their Eſtabliſhment; and on the contrary, to their Ruination: Neither have they Learned to give the ſame Liberty to others (in things relating to the Conſcience) as themſelves would deſire to have; and this is not to do as they would be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And therein they are ſhort of fulfilling the Royal Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let all people (who are making Laws to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel mens Conſcience) conſider how they are degenerated from God, and how darkneſs hath covered them, and hardneſs of heart hath ſeized on them; ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have regard unto tender Conſciences, but in the pride of their hearts would be Lords over the Conſciences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Surely they are not guided by the ſame Spirit that the Apoſtle was in the primitive times, who ſaid, <hi>Let every
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93507:123"/>
man be fully preſwaded in his own Conſcience,</hi> and this was true Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding all the Profeſſion that there hath been, and yet are in the World, and the Talk of God, and Chriſt, and Redemption, and Salvation by him, yet now, when the Son of God is come, is there faith to be found on Earth? or are people Redeemed from the Earth, or ſaved from the pollutions of the World? I tell <hi>you</hi> nay; for all who err from the Light of the Son of God in them, they are in the Alination, and Degeneration, and are ſtrangers unto God and his Covenant of Peace, <hi>and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning that Faith</hi> which gives the Saints victory over the World, and ſo are drove out into the Earth (not redeemed from it) but are Bond-ſlaves to corruption, and live in the pollutions of the World: And in this ſtate the whole World lyeth, notwithſtanding all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and talk of Religion which is amongſt them; and ſo their fruits plainly manifeſt it; and thereby it is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, that their Teachers were not ſent of the Lord, neither have they had his Word, nor ſtood in his Counſel; therefore have they not profitted the people, nor turned them from the evil of their wayes, neither are they brought to the knowledge of the Truth by which Freedom and Redemption is witneſſed: So their Preaching is vain, and their Faith is vain, and they remain in their ſins, which ſeparates them from God, and are dead while they live, and are unreſtored, and unreconciled, and have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their eternal wel-being: And when any comes into a ſerious Conſideration, and unto a true ſence of the ſad ſtate they are in, and how they have lived, and ſpent their time all their Life long: Then Judgment, and Wrath, Condemnation, and Pangs, and the Sorrows of Hell conpaſſeth them about; and then ſeeing themſelves

in the periſhing ſtate, are even at their wits end; yet theſe things they conſider not in the time of their proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all people every where, who deſire to come out of theſe Diſtractions, and Confuſions, and Hurryings, and Contentions about Faith, and Worſhip, and Ordinances, and out of the Pollutions which the World lives in, and to come into the <hi>Spiritual Worſhip which is in the Spirit and in the Truth:</hi> To you I ſay, that is <hi>the Spirit of Truth in you all (in which God will be worſhipped) which reproves you of ſin in your hearts; and as you come into obedience to that, it will bring you into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Worſhip:</hi> For <hi>the Spiritual Worſhip conſiſteth in Obedience to the Spirit;</hi> and this is the <hi>everlaſting Ordinance of God (viz.)

                  <p>THE main Controverſie with <hi>John Newman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this time, <hi>Whether or no the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament</hi> (ſo called) <hi>be not properly and principally called the Word of God, and that diſtinct from Christ, whoſe Name is called the Word? And whether the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93507:130"/>
Scriptures be not a perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other?</hi> Who, for the proving of the Affirmative, hath inſtanced ſeveral places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>My Work at this time will be to ſhew, That thoſe Scriptures, produced by him, do not any wiſe ſerve to prove his Affirmations, but rather the contrary; though he hath much wrong'd them, by wreſting of them, as is uſual with thoſe, who labour to pervert the Right Way of the Lord, as <hi>John Newman</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do; which I doubt not, but I ſhall ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Scripture that he produceth, as a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from whence to argue the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is <hi>Luke</hi> 11.28. where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Yea, rather Bleſſed are they, that hear the Word of God, and keep it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now (ſaith he in page three) whether it be Jeſus Chriſt, which in Scripture is ſtil'd the Word of God; a Name which is given unto him, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the words, which God hath ſpoken by his holy Prophets, and Bleſſed Son, and Apoſtles, in the two Teſtaments of his Will, &amp;c. be not the Word of God?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Chriſt did not intend the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament at that time, when he ſo ſpoke; but he meant himſelf, who was the Word that was with God in the beginning, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. whom they were to hear and obey, as the Father had given Commandment by the Mouthes of his Prophets, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by Immediate Voice from Heaven; as by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93507:130"/>
him ſhall ye hear, &amp;c.</hi> And when this Prophet was rais'd, and was with his three Diſciples in the Mount, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Voice from the Excellent Glory, ſaid, <hi>This is my Beloved SON, hear ye him,</hi> Mat. 17.5. This then is that Word, which they were bleſſed that heard, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Saying of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are your Ears, for they hear, &amp;c.</hi> For, many that had Ears could not hear the Word, though they had the Scriptures (that were then in being) which teſtify'd of the Word: So its plain that Chriſt ſpoke of himſelf, when he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that he ſpoke not of the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, there is not any thing can be more plain; becauſe the Scriptures that are call'd the new Teſtament were not then written, nay, not any part thereof: So that its great Ignorance in <hi>John Newman,</hi> to think that Chriſt ſpoke of the Scriptures, eſpecially of the new Teſtament, and not of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But then in page 4. he ſaith, <q>I ſhall undertake to prove, that the Scriptures of the two Teſtaments, &amp;c. are properly and principally call'd the Word of God, &amp;c.</q> And his firſt Proof is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.28, 30. where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid, <q>Thou wilt light my Candle; the Lord will enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my Darkneſs: And as for God, his Way is perfect; the Word of the Lord is try'd.</q> And from hence argueth, <hi>That the Scripture is the Word of God, which</hi> David <hi>ſpake of; Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>its the ſame that's call'd the Way of God:</hi> So takes it for granted, That the Scripture is the Way of God; and concludes, That it muſt needs follow, that the Scripture is the Word there ſpoken of, ſaying,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93507:131"/>
                     <q>It doth appear, that the Scriptures, or perfect Way of God, in which the Prophet walked, and by which he ſhould be enlighten'd, is here called, the Word of the Lord.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I cannot but Marvel, that men ſhould be ſo wilfully blind, to go about to wreſt the Scriptures after this manner; when never a word of <hi>David,</hi> here inſerted, ſo much as ſpeaks of the Scriptures, much leſs of the Old and New Teſtament. But he here ſpeaks, of what God, his Way, and Word was; and of what God, whom he ſaid, was his Lamp, would do for him: Likewiſe, in the 29th verſe (which <hi>J. N.</hi> willingly omits) he declares, what God had done for him, or, what himſelf had done by the Lord (not by Scripture) <hi>By thee, I have run through a Troop; and by my God, I have leapt over a Wall:</hi> And verſ. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>It is God that girdeth me with Strength, and maketh my Way perfect:</hi> [Mark] He did not ſay, That he made the Scripture a perfect Way for him; for the Scripture was not his Way, by which he run through the Troop: Nor did he ſay, That by the Scripture he would light his Candle, and enlighten his Darkneſs; but by Him, who is Light, by whom he run through a Troop. So that it appears, it was the Power and Strength of God, in which <hi>David</hi> walked, and by which the Lord did thoſe things for him, and not by Scripture: So that this ſerves nothing at all to prove the Scriptures the Word and Way of God; neither do I underſtand, that the Scriptures any where ſay, That they are the Way; but contrariwiſe, teſtifie, That Chriſt is the Way (whoſe Name is called, the Word of God) which was with God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and in the Boſom of the Father from Everlaſting
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93507:131"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> 1.18. nevertheleſs, the Law written in Tables of Stone, was, in the diſpenſation of time, the Rule, though not the Supream Rule, which they were to obſerve and do, until Chriſt the Seed came, who is the Way Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
                  <p>The next Scripture, offer'd by <hi>J. N.</hi> to prove the Scriptures the Word, is out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.100, 105. where the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my Feet, and a Light unto my Path.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now <hi>(ſaith J. N.)</hi> what this Word is, he ſheweth at large, in verſ. 97, 98, &amp; 101. where the Prophet plainly ſheweth, That it was the holy Law of God, which was his Meditation day and night: And further, he ſaith, <hi>Thou, through thy Commandments, hast made me wiſer then my Enemies:</hi> And in verſ. 101. to ſhew what this Way of God was, he ſaith, <hi>I have refrain'd my Feet from every falſe way, that I might keep thy Word:</hi> And in verſ. 106. he ſaith, <hi>I have ſworn, that I will perform it, that I may keep thy Judgments:</hi> From whence we may plainly ſee, That God's Word, <hi>which was a Lanthorn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Feet,</hi> and <hi>a Light unto his Path,</hi> which Word <hi>he had ſworn to keep;</hi> that it was the Commandments or Word of God, in which was contain'd the Will of God, in order to <hi>David's</hi> Salvation. And it is plain, the Word here is not meant of Chriſt, becauſe the Prophet calleth it, <hi>The Word of God;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>He had ſworn to keep it.</hi> And it cannot in reaſon be underſtood, That <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> or any other man, did ever keep Chriſt; for all his Saints are kept by him; for we are kept by the Power of Chriſt, through Faith unto Salvation, &amp;c.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> How can a rational Perſon judge, but that <hi>J.

Wherefore did he not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the 99th verſe alſo, as well as the 98th &amp; 100th, where <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have more Underſtanding, then my Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers?</hi> Was it not leſt People ſhould perceive, that ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David</hi> had ſome farther Acquaintance and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with God, then his Teachers had; and that God was his immediate Teacher, by his Word, which he ſent, and healed them that were in diſtreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.20. which <hi>was a Light unto</hi> David<hi>'s Feet, and a Lanthorn to his Path?</hi> A thing, which his Teachers were not ſo acquainted with, though they well knew the Law outwardly (which <hi>David</hi> alſo ſtricktly obſerved) as otherwiſe it cannot be rationally underſtood, that <hi>David</hi>'s Teachers did not well underſtand the Law, yet he had more underſtanding, then they; for, he was a Prophet of God, and knew the Word of the Lord, though it was (as he ſaid) <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſettled in Heaven,</hi> verſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, who can be ſo ignorant and blind, as to think, that he ſpoke of the Scriptures, when he ſaid, <hi>Thy Word is ſettled in Heaven:</hi> For, were the Scriptures ſettled in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93507:132"/>
Heaven? <hi>And in God I will praiſe thy Word:</hi> Was it the Scripture that he would praiſe? <hi>And I have hoped in thy Word:</hi> Was his Hope in the Scriptures, or in Chriſt, as in him that was to come? <hi>And mine Eyes fail for thy Word:</hi> Was it the Scriptures that his Eyes fail'd for? Surely no; the Scripture (ſo much of it, as was then written, which were chiefly the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi>) was obvious enough to him, when the Word might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn out of his ſight, for a Tryal unto him; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Joſeph, Pſal.</hi> 105.18, 19. <hi>Whoſe Feet they hurt with Fetters: Until the time that his Word came; the Word of the Lord try'd him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And who dares deny (without Preſumption) but that it was the ſame Word, which <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Was a Light unto his Path, and a Lamp unto his Feet?</hi> So that all <hi>J. N</hi> s. tearing aſſunder the Scriptures, with his additional Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, will not prove, that it was the Scriptures <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpoke of, in this place; but was indeed the Word, by which <hi>David</hi> (as a Prophet, to whom the Word of the Lord came) ſpoke forth that part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>David</hi> did meditate on the Law of God (which if I ſhould grant it to be only the outward Law, that came by <hi>Moſes</hi>) yet that doth not prove, that he call'd it the Word; nor can it be underſtood, that he meant the Scripture, when he ſo ſpoke of the Word, for the Reaſons afore given.</p>
                  <p>The Word was precious, or ſcarce, in thoſe dayes, which came to the Prophets, ſaying, <hi>So,</hi> and <hi>ſo;</hi> and thoſe Sayings are ſignified or contain'd in the Scriptures: But the Scriptures were not more ſcarce then, then at times before; though the Word was, of which there was a Famine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:93507:133"/>And though the Scriptures may be heard now, which contain the Saying of the Word, which the Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated; yet all that hear them, cannot be ſaid to hear the ſound of the Word, as they did, who heard thoſe ſayings demonſtrated, or ſounded out of the Mouthes of the Prophets, by the Word that ſo ſpoke.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>J. N.</hi> ſaith, <q>Its plain, the Word here is not mean of Chriſt, becauſe the Prophet calls it, the Word of God; and ſaith, <hi>He had ſworn to keep it:</hi> and it cannot in reaſon be underſtood, that <hi>David,</hi> or any man, did ever keep Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Here <hi>J. N.</hi> hath wrong'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's word; for he did not ſay, <hi>That he had ſworn to keep the Word;</hi> but, <hi>He had ſworn to keep his Righteous Judgments;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>He would obſerve the Judgments of the Lord, to walk in the Paths thereof;</hi> or, <hi>That he would walk according to the Spirit of Judgment:</hi> Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, It is but the unreaſonableneſs of <hi>J.N.</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That</hi> David, <hi>nor any man, did never keep Christ;</hi> for, they that keep in ſubjection to the Spirit of Chriſt, and dwell under his Government, may be properly ſaid to keep the Word, which is Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And there were in the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> thoſe that kept the Word, and ſuch deny'd not his Name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. [Mark that] <hi>He that kept the Word, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd not his Name, which is call'd the Word:</hi> and in verſ. 10. he ſaid, <hi>Becauſe thou hast kept the Word of my Patience, I will keep thee, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, can it reaſonably be underſtood, That it was the Scriptures, that were here call'd the Word of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which they kept; or that Scriptures were that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93507:133"/>
Name which they deny'd not, who kept the Word. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I cannot rationally judge, that any ſhould be ſo blind; but if they ſhould, the very next verſe will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear the matter, where it is ſaid, <hi>Hold fast that thou hast, that none take away thy Crown.</hi> [Mark] He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kept the Word of Patience, was exhorted, to hold that faſt which he had, that he might not loſe his Crown.</p>
                  <p>And can any rationally conclude, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was his Crown? Or elſe, Was it not the Word of Life (and of Patience) which was in the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures were written; and would be his <hi>Crown</hi> when Scriptures ſhould be no more: For, <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy, To lay hold on Eternal Life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. And muſt he not then lay hold on Chriſt, who is the Word, and the Life? 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. and <hi>John</hi> 14.6. And they that had receiv'd him, who was the Word and the Life, and was to be their Crown, as before is ſhew'd, and were to keep, or hold faſt that which they had receiv'd, May it not be properly ſaid, That they kept Chriſt? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none can be ſo ignorant, who underſtand the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to conclude, that no Man did ever keep Chriſt; although all his are kept from the hour of Temptation, by him (who is the Power of God) through Faith unto Salvation? By all which it plainly appears, That the words of the Prophet, produc'd by <hi>J. N.</hi> do not prove, nor intend to prove the <hi>Scriptures to be the Word of God,</hi> that the Prophets and Holy Men of God kept: although I ſhall eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that they do contain many ſayings and words, that proceeded from the Mouth of the Lord; all which were, and are, according to the ſeveral Diſpenſations of time, to which they relate, to be obſerv'd alſo.</p>

                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:93507:134"/>The next Scripture, produc'd by <hi>J.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, This doth not at all prove the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the Word, which the Prophet ſaid, was <hi>Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept unto them;</hi> for, though he ſaid, <hi>Whom ſhall I make to underſtand Doctrine?</hi> and in order to it ſaid, <hi>The Word of the Lord must be Precept upon Precept:</hi> Yet that doth not prove, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> was the Word; but the Doctrine was of the Word; and by the Word, that came unto the Prophet, was the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine demonſtrated;</hi> and they thereby made to underſtand it. And ſo the Word oft times came unto the Prophets (not the Scriptures) and bid them go, and ſpeak, ſo, and ſo; and the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which they preached, could not be properly call'd the Word it ſelf, that came to them; though the ſound of the Word was heard in the delivery of that Doctrine: But their Doctrine proceeded from the Word, which bid them ſo ſpeak; ſo that there was the Word, the Teacher, and the Doctrine thereof, the Teachings.</p>
                  <p>And this Word, ſo oft coming unto the Prophet, to bid him go and ſpeak unto the People; it might well be
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93507:134"/>
ſaid, <hi>That the</hi> Word of the Lord <hi>was Line upon Line unto them:</hi> ſo that it plainly appears, that this Word (here ſpoken of) was not intended to be the Scripture; neither doth this at all prove the Scriptures to be properly and principally call'd the Word of God, as <hi>J. Newman</hi> would have it.</p>
                  <p>Again, in pag. 7. <hi>J. N.</hi> ſaith, <q>Another Proof to confirm this Truth, is, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.13. where the Lord Chriſt doth affirm the Commands of God, in the firſt Teſtament, or Scriptures of the Prophets, to be the Word of God; becauſe he ſaid unto the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> in the 9th verſe, <hi>Full well ye reject the Commandement of God, that you may keep your own Traditions:</hi> and in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe, he ſaid, Making the Word of God of none effect, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not at all prove, that Chriſt call'd the Scripture of the Prophets the Word of God; for it relates only to that particular Command of God, viz. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother:</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in chap. 15.6. ſpeaking of the ſame thing, <hi>Thus have ye made the Commandment of God of none effect, by your Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> Now the Queſtion will be, whether <hi>Matthew</hi> or <hi>Mark</hi> gave the right relation of the words of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for, both theirs are but a Relation (in this matter) of what <hi>Christ</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews?</hi> Or, whether the Tranſlators did not wrong the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> in making one appear to ſpeak one thing, and the other another thing; ſeeing its plain, they both ſpoke of one thing which they had ſeen and heard of <hi>Christ?</hi> And this one thing was the Commandment, as aforeſaid, as <hi>Matthew</hi> plainly calls it: and <hi>Mark,</hi> in the 9th
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93507:135"/>
verſe, calls it, the <hi>Commandment</hi> alſo; from which we may rationally conclude, that the Fault was in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, to make the one differ from the other, in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; but if he did indeed call that Commandment the Word, yet that doth not prove the Scriptures to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd the <hi>Word of God;</hi> for that ſaying of Chriſt relates only to that one Command, which, with the reſt of the Commandments, are call'd the words which God ſpeak; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1. <hi>God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the Scriptures do contain a Relation of the words, that at ſundry times God ſpeak, I ſhall eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; but that they are properly and principally call'd the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as <hi>J. N.</hi> affirmeth, I do deny; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he produc'd any Scripture, that doth prove it, as I hope, by theſe few Lines, will appear to the Impartial Reader.</p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>J. N.</hi> concluding; That he hath prov'd the Scriptures of the firſt Teſtament to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> he ſaith, he ſhall labour to prove, that the Scriptures of the New Teſtament are alſo call'd the Word: and in pag. 8. he ſaith, <q>The firſt Scripture for Proof hereof, is, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25, 26, 27. where <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Preaching and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt, out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> to the <hi>Rulers,</hi> &amp;c. pray d unto the Lord, <hi>That they might Preach this Word with Boldneſs</hi> (And ſaith) 'Its plain from the ſcope of this place, that the Preaching and Teaching of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, is properly and principally call'd the Word of God.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> How hath <hi>J. N.</hi> beſotted himſelf, with labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93507:135"/>
to pervert the Truth? Firſt ſaith, he hath prov'd the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament to be properly call'd the <hi>Word of God;</hi> and now ſaith, Its plain the Scriptures of the New Teſtament are principally call'd the Word: And ſometimes ſaith, Chriſt is call'd the Word of God: [Mark] <hi>Christ call d the Word,</hi> but <hi>the Scriptures principally call'd the Word;</hi> ſo that he ſets the Scriptures (as the Word) above Chriſt, by ſaying, <hi>principally, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And beſides, How many Words of God he will make, or ſeem to make ſomething he would have without, to be call'd the Word, to keep People from enclining to the Word in the heart, leſt they ſhould come to know <hi>Christ</hi> manifeſted in them; which before he confeſſeth the Apoſtles preached, when they pray'd, <hi>That they might ſpeak the Word with Boldneſs:</hi> [Mark] If they preached <hi>Christ,</hi> and prayed, that they might ſpeak <hi>that Word</hi> with Boldneſs; then <hi>Christ</hi> was that Word, and not the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> although their Preaching of him, and bearing Witneſs of his Appearance and Coming, was according to the Scriptures of the Prophets: For they ſhew'd the People out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>that Jeſus was Christ,</hi> Acts 28.23. Yet this doth not prove, that their Preachings and Teachings of him were by the Scriptures of the New Teſtament; for they were not then written: But they preached by vertue of the Word and Spirit that was in them, which they had handled of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>

                  <p>His next is pag. 9. to the ſame purpoſe, where he ſaith, <q>In <hi>Acts</hi> 5.42. its ſaid, the Apoſtle did daily Preach and Teach Jeſus Chriſt; and this Preaching and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, is in the 6th chapter, verſe 4. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The Miniſtry of the Word, &amp;c.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer, Its true, they that preach Chriſt, they preach the Word; and they that preach the Word, they preach Chriſt; for Chriſt is the Word, as before ſhew'd, and hereafter ſhall be more largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
                  <p>But then ſaith <hi>J. N.</hi> 
                     <q>The Word of God inrceaſed, &amp;c.</q> (from whence in pag. 18. he argueth) <q>That none can in Reaſon imagine, that the Word of God, that ſo grew and multiply'd, can be underſtood of Chriſt</q> (though he confeſſeth) <q>That the increaſe of the Word was ſo mighty, notwithſtanding the Oppoſition that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſt met with.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What can be underſtood by the Multiplying, Increaſing, or Prevailing of the Word of God, but the prevailency of Chriſt in that Work, which (in and by his Servants, the Apoſtles, according to the Pleaſure of the Father's Will) he had undertaken, notwithſtanding all the Oppoſition that he in them met withal, according to that Saying, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. <hi>Every Tongue that riſeth up in Judgment against Thee, Thou ſhalt condemn:</hi> So that through the powerful Operation of the Word Chriſt, <hi>Which in them
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93507:136"/>
wrought mightily both towards the Circumciſion, and Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Gal.</hi> 2.8. many were made to ſubmit thereunto, and to confeſs thereunto; and thereby the Increaſe of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was known, which the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Should be without End, Iſa.</hi> 9.7. And the number of the Diſciples (or Believers on the Word) were multiply'd; ſo that the Word multiply'd the Diſciples thereof; and grew in Dominion over its Oppoſers; and increas'd its Goverment in and among'ſt them: And this in Plainneſs and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, was the Growth, Multiplying, Increaſing, and Prevailing of Chriſt the Word; and yet there was no more then one Chriſt prevailing, and increaſing in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and multiplying his Diſciples; though <hi>J. N.</hi> cannot ſee, but there muſt of neceſſity be more then one Chriſt, if by the increaſe of the Word be underſtood of Chriſt: ſo that although he concludeth, it muſt needs be the Doctrine, contain'd in the Scriptures, intended by the increaſe of the Word, yet here he may ſee his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therein</p>
                  <p>Again, In pag. 9. &amp; 10. <hi>J. N.</hi> ſaith, <q>That in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.20. the Preaching and Teaching of Jeſus Chriſt is call'd the Word of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I have already anſwer'd, that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Jeſus Chriſt is the Preaching of the Word; for his Name is call'd the Word: Yet is doth not follow, as <hi>J. N.</hi> would have it, that all the Diſputings, which the Apoſtle had for the ſpace of three Moneths, was the Word: Its true, he diſputed and perſwaded the things of the Kingdom (according to the Scriptures of the Prophets) by Vertue of the Word that was in him; ſo that all they of <hi>Aſia</hi> heard the Word, or the ſound thereof, when the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93507:137"/>
Doctrine thereof was by it ſelf demonſtrated; <hi>For, from you ſounded out the Word of the Lord,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. But the Apoſtle did not call his Preachings and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings the Word; but that which he preached: For he preached Chriſt; but his Preachings were not Chriſt, but a Teſtimony of him; as Chriſt ſaid concerning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>They are they that teſtifie of me, Joh.</hi> 5.39. By which it apprears, that Chriſt was the Word which he preached, and which they in <hi>Aſia</hi> heard the ſound of, according to that Saying of Chriſt, <hi>The Hour cometh, and now is, when the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son, &amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Argument is but like the reſt, which make nothing to prove the Scriptures to be principally call d the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Again, <hi>(ſaith J.N.)</hi> I ſhould have left proſecuting this Subject, but this Truth yet finding more Friends to plead its Cauſe, I am not willing to be a Hinderance, &amp;c.</q> And then quotes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1, 2. where the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He had not handled the Word of God deceitfully.</hi> 
                     <q>Now <hi>(ſaith J.N.)</hi> what Word of God was this, which he had not handled deceitfully, but the Miniſtry he had receiv'd, even the <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Teaching</hi> of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, as is plain in the 3d, 4th. &amp; 5th verſes? For, what he calleth the Miniſtry in the 1ſt verſe, in the 2d the Word of God, in the following he calleth it the Goſpel, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt according to the Goſpel; ſo that its clear by this Witneſs alſo, that the Preaching and Teaching of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, &amp;c. is properly and principally call'd, <hi>The Word of God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truly <hi>J. N.</hi> had need find better Friends, or
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93507:137"/>
ſome that ſpeak more pertinent to his buſineſs, then this which he hath here produced, or elſe he may labour (as before he ſaid he ſhould) long enough to prove Scripture the Word of God, and have all to do when he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: For, if I ſhould grant that he called his Miniſtry, or that of, and from which he miniſtred, the <hi>Word;</hi> yet that doth not prove the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Word;</hi> becauſe, the Life and Spirit of his Miniſtry is not contain'd in the Scripture: Or, if I ſhould acknowledge the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to be the <hi>Word;</hi> yet that doth not prove the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Word;</hi> For, <hi>The Goſpel is the Power of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and ſo are not the Scriptures; and the Goſpel is Everlaſting, but the Scriptures are not ſo. But <hi>J.N.</hi> would make the Scriptures to be the Word, the Goſpel, the Miniſtry, and all; and jumbles all together, and then ſays, <hi>The Apoſtle calls it ſo;</hi> when the Apoſtle ſaith no ſuch thing; but ſpeaks of his Miniſtry; and of the Goſpel, which is the Power of God; and of the (Word, which endureth forever, which by the Goſpel, the Power) was preached unto them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25.</p>
                  <p>And as to that Queſtion, <q>What <hi>Word of God</hi> was this that he had not handled Deceitfully?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, It was the <hi>Word</hi> which was from the beginning, as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Which they had Seen and Handled;</hi> which were not the Scriptures; for they were not from the beginning: but the <hi>Word</hi> was, which they had handled, and which they handled not deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but in Simplicity declar'd openly, what they receiv'd by its ſecret operation, and mighty working in them (according as Chriſt commanded them) without adding
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93507:138"/>
thereto, or diminiſhing therefrom; and hence it was that they ſaid, <hi>They Handled it not Deceitfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Again, <hi>(ſaith J. N.)</hi> The ſecond VVitneſs, that appeareth to countenance this Truth, is in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25. where the Apoſtle calleth, the Preaching of the Goſpel the Word of God: but for the better underſtanding of this VVitneſs, let us ſee verſ. 23. where the Apoſtle uſeth theſe words to the Church, <hi>If you continue in the Faith, grounded and ſettled, and not remov'd from the Hope of the Goſpel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every Creature under Heaven: Whereof,</hi> he ſaith, in verſ. 25. <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>am made a Miniſter:</hi> But what to do? He anſwereth, <hi>To fulfil the Word of God:</hi> Now, what Word of God was this that <hi>Paul</hi> did fulfil, but only his Miniſtry, in Preaching and Teaching of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Goſpel, which he here calleth the <hi>Word</hi> of God? So that there is no Truth more plain then this, that the Scriptures of the New <hi>Teſtament</hi> are properly and principally call'd the Word of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely <hi>J.N.</hi> hath a great Conceit of his blind Affirmations; it appears, as oft times I have ſeen it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ignorance in ſome is as great a Cauſe of Confidence, as ſound Knowledge is in others: VVhat Reaſon hath <hi>J. N.</hi> from the Scriptures before mention'd, to affirm the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to be properly call'd the <hi>Word of God?</hi> Or the Word there ſpoken of by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to be meant the Scriptures, which he ſaid were given him to fulfil? For, in the next verſe he declareth what that VVord was, viz. <hi>The Myſtery which hath been hid from Ages, and from Generations; but now made manifest in his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93507:138"/>
Saints: To whom</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God would make known what is the Riches of the Glory of his Myſtery amongst the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>which is, Christ in you the Hope of Glory.</hi> [Mark Reader] He ſaith, The VVord which he was to fulfil, was the Myſtery, &amp;c. and the Myſtery was, Chriſt in them, &amp;c. So that the VVitneſs, that <hi>J. N.</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, teſtifieth againſt his Affirmation as abſolutely as may be, to the utter overthrow of his Cauſe, by which the Ignorance and Blindneſs of <hi>J. N.</hi> appears.</p>
                  <p>But then he ſaith, in pag. 12. <q>I ſhall give but one Scripture more for the Proof of this <hi>Truth,</hi> and that is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Where the Apoſtle calleth the Doctrine of Christ, the Word of God:</hi> For <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> let us ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith in the firſt verſe, where he giveth <hi>Titus</hi> a Charge, to preach ſound Doctrine; and layeth down the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars thereof, what he ſhould preach, and the Perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to whom he ſhould preach: and giveth them Inſtruction in the 5th verſe, That they ſhould walk to the Doctrine or Teaching anſwerably; and the Reaſon he gave was this, <hi>Lest the word of God ſhould be Blaſphem'd:</hi> ſo that the Doctrine he gave in Charge to <hi>Titus,</hi> with all the particulars of the Doctrine, the ſame in the 5th verſe he calls, <hi>The Word of God.</hi>
                     </q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Concluſion is utterly falſe; he doth not ſay (nor in effect ſay) That the Doctrines, with all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Doctrines, are the Word: Nor can it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be concluded, That it was the Scripture, or the Doctrine, that he ſpoke of, when he ſaid, <hi>Lest the Word of God ſhould be Blaſphem'd:</hi> But rather, that worthy Name by which they were call'd (which Name, they who kept the Word deny'd not, as before ſhew'd) For, if they
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93507:139"/>
ſhould not walk according to the Doctrine of the VVord, which they taught; the Ignorant that were without, or they that watched for Iniquity, might be ready to judge, that there was a difficiency in the VVord, by which they were taught, or in the Name which they profeſſed and walked in; and ſo be encourag'd to ſlight and ſpeak evil of the ſame: and thereby the VVord (by which they were taught) might be blaſphemed, through their not walking according to the Doctrine thereof, who made a Profeſſion of it: ſo that the Apoſtle, in ſaying, <hi>Lest the Word of God ſhould be blaſphem'd,</hi> doth not at all call the Doctrine the VVord; nor doth this in the leaſt ſerve to prove the Scriptures to be properly call'd the <hi>Word of God;</hi> although thereupon J.

to hear the ſound of, but alſo to believe and obey the ſame: And this Truth is confirm'd in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. where its ſaid, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your Brethren, (ſaith</hi> Moſes) <hi>like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all things, whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you:</hi> Obſerve that, <hi>Him ſhall you hear in all things:</hi> From whence we may learn, That Chriſt gives no Licence to his People to pick and cull his Wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to hear and obey him in all things, whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto them. And that the Scriptures are in force as a Perfect Rule, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. where the Apoſtle doth affirm the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof, and ſaith, <hi>The Myſtery that was kept ſecret ſince the World began, is now made manifest by the Scripture of the Prophets, according to the Commandment of the Everlaſting God, and made known unto all Nations for the Obedience of Faith, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, I would not be miſ-taken in my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as though, <hi>I went about to under-value the Scriptures of Truth;</hi> or, <hi>as though I had ſlight eſteem of them</hi> (for, I do in reallity own them; and do acknowledge them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many true Teſtimonies of him, whoſe Name is call'd the Word of God; who is the perfect Way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the alone Guide, that leadeth unto Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; a Leader and Commander unto his People, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father: I ſay, I own the Scriptures to contain many true Teſtimonies concerning him, and concerning many other things; and that they ought to be believ'd, &amp;c. But that they are therefore a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other, I cannot own; for, they no where teſtifie of, or concerning themſelves: And if it were certainly ſo, That they were a Perfect Rule, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93507:140"/>
no other (as <hi>J. N.</hi> affirmeth) then it muſt of neceſſity follow, That they, who have not the Scriptures, are without a Perfect Rule; and that before the Scriptures were written, the Ancients and Worthies of God, as, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Noah, Lot, Enoch, &amp;c.</hi> had no Perfect Rule to walk by; except he could prove, That the Rule by which they walked <hi>(and by which</hi> Abraham <hi>was to walk before God, and be Perfect)</hi> was no more to be a Rule, after the Scriptures were written; the which I no where find recorded in the Scriptures: But contrariwiſe, That ſame Rule, by which they walked, bore Witneſs unto the Scripture: And the Scriptures offer'd by <hi>J. N.</hi> do not at all prove, that they are a Perfect Rule; except it could be prov'd, that they contain all things that Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles to preach and teach, which in reaſon none can conclude; for, although the Scriptures be a part of what they preacht and taught, yet there is but very little of what they taught and preacht declar'd in them; nor indeed, little at all of the Preachings and Teachings of the moſt part of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> therefore, if their Preachings and Teachings be the Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, then the Scriptures are not indeed that Perfect Rule, they containing in them ſuch a ſmall part of what they preacht and taught.</p>
                     <p>Again, It cannot be underſtood, That the Scriptures were the Goſpel that was preacht to every Creature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven; for, a great part of the People under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, never heard (nor heard of) the Scriptures: <hi>But the Goſpel was preached to, or in, every Creature under Heaven, Col.</hi> 1.23. Therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again, The Goſpel that they preached, was, and is Everlaſting: But the Scriptures cannot be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally underſtood to be Everlaſting, becauſe they are things
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93507:141"/>
that are ſeen, which are temporal; therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not the Everlaſting Goſpel, but the Power of God is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16.</p>
                     <p>And what doth that ſaying of <hi>Moſes</hi> avail, to prove the <hi>Scriptures</hi> a perfect Rule for all men to walk by? For, if that Prophet was, and is to be heard in all things, then he is to be looked unto as a Guide, and Commander, and Ruler; and if a Ruler, then his Spirit, by which he rules, is the Perfect Rule above Scripture.</p>
                     <p>And as to his ſaying, <q>
                           <hi>The Apoſtle confirms the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be a Perfect Pule by theſe words,</hi> The Myſtery that was kept ſecret ſince the World began, is now made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> What, though that great Myſtery was made manifeſt, according to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the Prophets, that doth not prove the Scriptures a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by; for, the Manifeſtation of that Myſtery by the Scriptures of the Prophets, was no more but their perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (or ſhewing) them out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets concerning Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.23. of whom all the Prophets bore Teſtimony: For this Jeſus, concerning whom the Apoſtles (by Revelation and Commandment of the Everlaſting God) perſwaded the People, was the Myſtery that had been hid, as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Colloſians,</hi> cap. 1. ver. 26, 27. declareth, ſaying, <hi>The Myſtery which hath been hid from Ages and Generations, but now is made manifest, &amp;c.</hi> Which is Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory [Mark] <hi>Is now made manifest:</hi> So here was the manifeſting of that Myſtery, by the Scriptures of the Prophets, even by perſwading them, or ſhewing them out of the Prophets concerning Jeſus: ſo that the Apoſtle doth not affirm (nor in effect
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:93507:141"/>
affirm) in the Scripture, <hi>That the Scriptures are a Perfect Rule;</hi> but ſimply declares, That by the Commandment of the Everlaſting God they made known that Myſtery (or preached Jeſus) by (or out of) the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the Prophets, who had teſtified of him that was to come, and was then come according to their Teſtimony, who is the Way, the Myſtery, and the Word, which all are to hear, obey, and keep.</p>
                     <p>But then ſaith <hi>J. N.</hi> 
                        <q>This is that Rule that Chriſt directeth unto in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39, 40. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have Eternal Life:</hi> and to take away all Objections, as if it were only their <hi>thoughts,</hi> and not really ſo, he addeth theſe words, <hi>And they are they which teſtifie of me:</hi> and by way of Reproof, becauſe they did not ſo do, he again ſaith, <hi>You will not come to me that you may have Life;</hi> by which he plainly ſheweth, that there was Life therein, by dutiful Obedience by Faith in him; ſo that here the great Prophet and Teacher of his People ſendeth us to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as a Rule through Faith to come to Life.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> How wilfully blind this man ſeems to appear, or like one that would put out his own Eyes, and others alſo! to wreſt and pervert the words of Chriſt in ſuch a groſs and ſhameful manner, by tearing of them in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and mixing his own Imaginations therewith, to make them look quite another way, or to import another thing; for that which <hi>J. N.</hi> argueth Chriſt confirmeth (<hi>viz.</hi> Their thoughts of having Life in the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) he indeed reproved, as the words in themſelves without wreſting clearly ſignifie; for ſome Tranſlations render it thus, <hi>Ye ſearch the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93507:142"/>
Eternal Life; and they are they which teſtifie of Me; and ye will not come unto Me:</hi> Mark, <hi>Ye ſearch, &amp;c.</hi> he tells them they did ſearch; but why? becauſe they thought to have Eternal Life in them, which were but a Teſtimony of him, who was the Life; and he (by way of Reproof to them, for not believing on him, in whom Life was, and of whom the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which they ſearched) did teſtifie) ſaid, <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have Life:</hi> [Mark] his <hi>Me</hi> here ſpoken of, that they would not come to for Life, was not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, of whom the Scriptures teſtified: ſo that he did not plainly ſhew, <hi>That there is Life in the Scriptures,</hi> as <hi>J. N.</hi> (either wilfully or ignorantly) affirmeth; nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to them as <hi>A Rule to come to Life:</hi> But reproves them becauſe they did not come unto him for Life, of whom the <hi>Scripture</hi> teſtified: ſo that the moſt <hi>J. N.</hi> hath done by this Argument is, even manifeſted his perverſe crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit, by which he wreſts and perverts the Scriptures, and would ſet them in the place of Chriſt, to give Life: But what is the End of the crooked <hi>Serpent</hi> in this Work, but to keep people from coming unto Chriſt the <hi>Power of God,</hi> through which Life Eternal is received by all that follow and obey him, who is the Truth, whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth will lead into all Truth, as a certain Rule for all to walk by, and in, which Chriſt directed them to wait for, as a Guide to walk by; and the Apoſtle exhorted them to walk in the Spirit, ſaying, <hi>There is no Condemnation to ſuch, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Asts</hi> 1.4, 5. And all this the ſubtil <hi>Serpent</hi> doth under pretence of Promoting (and not Perverting) the right Way of God, and Rule of Life; but this ſerves not (as before ſhewed) to prove, That Chriſt directed to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as a Rule to come to Life; but that he reproved
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93507:142"/>
them for that they would not come to him, who was the the Life, that they might have Life.</p>
                     <p>But then ſaith <hi>J. N.</hi> 
                        <q>This Truth is confirmed in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 15, 16, 17. where the Apoſtle ſheweth, the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus</q> (And from hence <hi>J. N.</hi> argueth) <q>That if the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe to Salvation through Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus, then the Scriptures are a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other: But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to made us wiſe unto Salvation through Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus; therefore the Scriptures are a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, That Argument is fala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; for, though the Scriptures are able to make wiſe to Salvation through Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus; yet it doth not follow (according to the ſequel of the major) that the Scriptures (the Faith in Chriſt Jeſus being left out, as <hi>J. N.</hi> hath done) are a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other; becauſe its through that Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, that they are able to make wiſe, &amp;c. which Faith he makes no mention of in his Aſſumption and Concluſion, that they are a Perfect Rule, &amp;c. by which the Falaciouſneſs of his Argument appears.</p>
                     <p>And indeed its neceſſary, that all ſhould underſtand how the Scriptures are able to make wiſe unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through Faith, &amp;c. for, the Scriptures here ſpoken of (and which Chriſt ſpoke of, when he ſaid, <hi>Ye ſearch
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:93507:143"/>
the Scriptures, &amp;c.</hi>) cannot be otherwiſe underſtood then the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, becauſe the other was not then written: And thoſe Scriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were they that teſtified of Chriſt, who is the great Salvation of God: And God ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>He had given him a Covenant of Light to lighten the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>to be for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth:</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets likewiſe ſhewed the time when, and the place where this <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be born and brought forth in that Body which was prepar'd for him; in which old <hi>Simeon</hi> beheld the Salvation, to wit, <hi>The Light of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the Glory of</hi> Iſrael: ſo that the Scriptures of the Prophets, containing in them ſo many clear and infallible Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the great Salvation of God, and of the time and place of the Appearance thereof, they were able through Faith in Chriſt to make him wiſe, or to give an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that he was the great Salvation of God that was then appear'd, according to the Teſtimonies of the Prophets, which from a Child he had known: And ſo on this wiſe, coming to the Knowledge of the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God by Faith in him, he in the ſame Faith did doubtleſs follow him, as a <hi>Sheep</hi> that knew his Voice, that ſo he might receive Life Eternal (which he gives to his Followers) and become an Heir of that Salvation, which through Faith in Chriſt he was made wiſe unto; and ſo coming as a <hi>Sheep</hi> to be a Follower of the true <hi>Shepherd,</hi> he own'd him for his only Guide, and his Spirit as the only Zule to walk by, and to ſpeak by, whoſe Preaching was thereby, even with words that it ſelf taught, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                     <p>And this is that Perfect Rule which cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as the Scriptures may, as <hi>J.N.</hi> confeſſeth; and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93507:143"/>
ſo cannot be ſaid to be a Perfect Rule, if corrupted: And indeed <hi>J.N.</hi> is one that greatly corrupts them (as he ſtates them) thinking thereby to prove them a Perfect Rule, even as before ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>The next Argument to prove Scriptures a perfect Rule is, <q>That if the Scriptures be given by Inſpiration, and are profitable for Doctrine, for Correction, for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all <hi>Good Works,</hi> then the Scriptures are an Abſolute and a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other: but the Scriptures are, &amp;c. therefore, &amp;c</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Scriptures (though not all Scriptures) were given by Inſpiration of God, I ſhall grant; and that they are profitable, as aforeſaid, I ſhall acknowledge: but that they are therefore an abſolute and a perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other, as <hi>J.N.</hi> affirmeth, that I do not acknowledge, but deny; becauſe that may be profitable to man in order to the perſecting of him to all Good Works, which may not be an abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule for him to walk by, and none other; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, One man may be profitable to another in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructing of him by the Spirit of the Lord, to walk in the Light and Spirit of the Son of God, which the Father hath ſent into the Heart, that ſo by that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Power of it, he may be able to deny all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and be furniſhed thereby perfectly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all <hi>Good Wooks;</hi> herein I ſay one man may be profitable to another, and yet it cannot therefore be ſaid, That that man, who is ſo profitable &amp;c. is an abſolute and perfect
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93507:144"/>
Rule for all men to walk by, and no other; for it were ridiculous: ſo that although the Scriptures be profitable, as aforeſaid; it doth not at all follow (as <hi>J. N.</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) that they are therefore a Perfect Rule, and no other.</p>
                     <p>But that Word, Light, or Spirit of Truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, from whence the Scriptures proceeded, and which by the Scriptures we are inſtructed to walk in, to hear, and obey (which cannot be corrupted, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may) that is the alone, abſolute, and perfect Rule, all men ought to walk by, and none other, as ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9.20. <hi>I gave them my Good Spirit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them.</hi> And this is that Rule or Leader which Chriſt directeth to, <hi>Even the Spirit of Truth, which will lead into all Truth, Joh.</hi> 16.13. the ſame the Apoſtle directeth to, ſaying, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and you ſhall not fulfil the Lusts of the Fleſh</hi> [Mark] What more Perfect Rule can be then that which keeps from the fulfilling the Luſts which bring forth ſin; for if the Luſts be not obey'd and fulfilled, the ſin is not acted; therefore ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>He that abideth in him ſinneth not;</hi> by all which it appears that <hi>J.N.</hi> hath not proved that the Scriptures are a Perfect Rule, and none other: Neither do the Scriptures any where te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of themſelves, as a Perfect Rule, excluding all other: But frequently bear Teſtimony unto that one antient ſtanding RULE, which was from rhe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from which the Scriptures were given forth, and which they direct unto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Again, (ſaith <hi>J. N.</hi> pag. 26.) For further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Truth I ſhall add ſome few Arguments more, that the New Teſtament Way is a Perfect
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:93507:144"/>
Rule for all men to walk by, and none other.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This wholly alters the Caſe; for it is not the New Teſtament Way being a Perfect <hi>Rule,</hi> &amp;c. that we are contending againſt; neither will his proving the new Teſtament Way to be a perfect Rule, at all prove the Scriptures to be a perfect <hi>Rule;</hi> except he could firſt prove the Scriptures to be the New Teſtament Way, which he is never able to do; for its declared in the Scriptures cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the New Teſtament, That Chriſt, who is God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Light, ſaid, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Abide in me, &amp;c. cap.</hi> 15.4. <hi>And my Sheep bear my Voyce, and they follow me, and I give to them Eternal Life, Joh.</hi> 10.27, 28.</p>
                     <p>Another New Teſtament Way or Perfect <hi>Rule</hi> then this, for men to walk in, and by, I no where read of in the Scripture of Truth; but this Way (as the New and Living Way) which leads to the Holieſt of all, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently borne witneſs of in the Scriptures, which (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſaid) contain many Teſtimonies concerning this Juſt One, who is the Way, the Word, the Truth, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, the whole ſcope or drift of the Scriptures, or of what is contained therein, is to direct and enduce people to walk in him, and according to him, who is the Way, the true <hi>Shepherd,</hi> that carries his Lambs in his Arms (Mark, if his Lambs are in his Arm, then he is eſſentially preſent with them.)</p>
                     <p>And I do no where read in the Scriptures that they are called the New Teſtament, or the New Teſtament Way; but they teſtifie of the New Teſtament, that it is the Spirit that giveth Life, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. the Apoſtle
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93507:145"/>
ſaith, <hi>Who hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life:</hi> And they teſtifie of the Way, that it is Chriſt,; ſo that the Way of the Spirit (which is the New Covenant) is Chriſt, and they that are led by the Spirit, they walk in Chriſt the New Teſtament Way; ſo that if <hi>J. N.</hi> had proved the New Teſtament Way to be a perfect Rule, &amp;c. it had ſerved nothing for his purpoſe to prove the Scriptures a perfect Rule, they being proved not to be the New Teſtament; as alſo ſaid the Angel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>John,</hi> cap. 19. verſ. 10. <hi>The Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Propheſie:</hi> though I do acknowledge, as before, That this New Teſtament, or New Covenant, or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Jeſus is teſtified of in the Scriptures of Truth; yet they are not the thing, nor do they contain the thing in them which they teſtifie of, as <hi>J. Newman</hi> ſeems to imply they do, as hereafter may be ſignified.</p>
                     <p>But inſtead of proving the New Teſtament Way a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> he goeth about to prove the Scriptures a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule,</hi> but never proves (nor goes about to prove) them to be the New Teſtament Way; but takes that for granted (as far as I perceive) although that is the principal matter wherein the Controveſie lies betwixt us, which I plainly perceive <hi>J.N.</hi> doth not underſtand, though he hath ſo deeply engag'd himſelf: For, if he could have proved the Scriptures, called the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to be the <hi>New Teſtament Way,</hi> I ſhould not have put Pen to Paper to have contended againſt their being a <hi>perfect Rule</hi> for all men to walk by: But herein is the great Miſtake amongſt many (as alſo in this man) They put the Dead Letter for the Living Word, and the Scriptures for the Way, and ſo would ſet them in the ſtead of the thing which they do
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93507:145"/>
but teſtifie of; and thereby keep people alwayes learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth, which ſanctifieth and ſetteth free, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>J. N.</hi> like a man fighting with the Wind (or like one that ſets up a Poppit of his own, and ſuppoſeth it to be anothers, and then lies fighting with it, when he has done) rumbles over a great deal of ſtuff (like one that wanteth Work) contending againſt a Third Covenant, or a Third Teſtament Way, arguing in the 26th page of his Book, <q>That if a Third Covenant, or a Third Teſtament Way hath not been any where promiſed of God, then the Second is ſtill in force, for all men to walk by, and none other.</q> And for my part, I know none that aſſert a Third Covenant, or a Third Teſtament Way; nor yet any that deny the Second to be in force: ſo that <hi>J.N.</hi> hath buſied himſelf to no purpoſe; as I ſaid before, like one beating of the Air; but I do not intend ſo to buſie my ſelf, to contend againſt him about things in which I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd: For, as I ſaid, I own no other Covenant nor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Way, but the <hi>Second Covenant,</hi> which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the Mouthes of his Prophets, ſaying, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>This ſhall be the Covenant that I will make, &amp;c. I will put my Law in their Inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts; and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People: And they ſhall no more teach every man his Neighbour,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me, &amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. he ſaid, <hi>This is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, my Spirit which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and my Words which I have put into thy Mouth ſhall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed's Seed, ſaith the Lord, from hence forth and for evermore.</hi> [Mark] This Law and Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93507:146"/>
the New Covenant, the New Teſtament Way, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified of in the Scriptures of Truth, to be an Everlaſting Covenant; this we own to be a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, unto the End of the World, and none other. And for a third Covenant, or third Teſtament Way, I know none aſſert it; therefore I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to contend about it; but ſhall leave that part of his Book for thoſe whom it concern, if there be any; though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well but obſerve, that he hath offer'd many fooliſh, falacious and ignorant Arguments; pretending thereby to prove the New Teſtament Way ſtill in force, and to be ſo to the End, which I have already granted (and ſhall be ready ſo to do at all times) but ſtill he miſtakes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by putting the Dead Letter in the place of the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit; and directeth people to the Letter for Life, when its only the Spirit that giveth Life, as before is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and ſo he ſtumbleth at the Stumbling-Stone; a Rock, which many have run againſt, and have been ſplit.</p>
                     <p>And ſo after he hath rumbled over divers ſylogiſtical Argments, which ſerve to ſignifie, that he loves to hear himſelf talk <hi>Logick;</hi> thereby ſtill labouring to prove, <hi>That no Third Covenant, or third Teſtament Way is to be expected, for which cauſe the Second is to ſtand in force unto the End, &amp;c.</hi> He then, in page 42. of his Book, comes to lay down ſome ſad Conſequences, <q>Which will <hi>(as he ſaith)</hi> follow by denying the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and by making them inſufficient as a Rule in order to Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and firſt, <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> It taketh away the general Ground of Faith from all men. 2dly, It denyeth the Ground of Faith for the Remiſſion of ſins. 3dly, It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth void the Exerciſes of Faith in the precious Promiſes of God; for what hath Faith to exerciſe it ſelf in, but
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93507:146"/>
only the Promiſes of God in the Scriptures? 4thly, It denieth the Comforts of Faith; for all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that Faith can bring to the ſoul, muſt be brought from the precious Promiſes of God in the Scripture. 5thly, It Deſtroyeth the Support and Supplyes of Grace to the Soul in a time of Affliction; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Scripture to be the Word of God, is to deny the Fountain and Well-ſpring of Comforts to the Soul. 6thly, It denieth the Knowledge of Acceptance with God. 7thly, If the Scriptures be denied to be the Word of God, and thereby made inſufficient as a Rule, &amp;c. then all men are left in the dark; for no man is able to know that God will ſave any, but by his Word, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Scriptures; for this is the Word of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that which directeth to the Means by which we ſhall obtain Life. 8thly, Without this (meaning Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) we know not that there is any God, or Chriſt, or Salvation by God in Chriſt, &amp;c. Laſtly, It leaveth men to walk by Fancy or Imagination, &amp;c.</q>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> How doth it take away the general ground of Faith from all men, to deny the Scriptures to be the Word, and Rule, &amp;c. ſeeing the Word is ſtill owned to be in beeing, and to be heard, which was the Ground and Author of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Holy Men of God, who believed before the Scriptures were written?<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.</note> And becauſe they believed, therefore they ſpoke forth the Scriptures: by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That the Faith, that was once deliver'd to the Saints (which we are earneſtly to contend for) was received by them through hearing of the Word, before the Scriptures were written; and therefore the Scriptures were not the Ground of their Faith: ſo that to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is not to deny or take away the Ground of that Faith, which by the Spirit or Word was once deliver'd to the Saints: For the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And this Author of Faith (as I ſaid before) was heard and believed before the Scriptures were written; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame this day as yeſterday, and the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

a Foundation of Faith that ſtandeth ſure, and is not a far off from every one, <hi>but is nigh, even the Word nigh thee, in thy Heart and in thy Mouth;</hi> and this is the Word of Faith which the Apoſtle preached, and which we preach, by the hearing of which Faith cometh: ſo that denying the Scriptures to be the Word is not to deny the Ground and Foundation of true Faith; neither is it in the leaſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-value the holy Scriptures, which ſo frequently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of the Ground, and Foundation; and Author of the true Faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as for his affirming, <q>That to deny the Scriptures to be the Word, is to deny the Ground of Faith for the Remiſſion of ſins.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer No; if the Word be the Ground (as moſt true it is) the Ground is not deny'd by denying Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word; becauſe the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which teſtifie of the Word, are before proved not to be the Word.</p>
                     <p>And they which had the Seal of Acceptance with God, had (without Controverſie) the Seal of Remiſſion of ſins; becauſe, without Remiſſion there can be no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, But the Servants of God had the <hi>Seal</hi> or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Acceptance with God, even ſome before any part of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written, as <hi>Abel, Enoch, Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> therefore the Scriptures were not the Ground of Faith for the Remiſſion of ſins, but the Word which was before the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written: ſo that to deny the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the Word of God, is not to deny the Ground of Faith for the Remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                     <p>And the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who ſometime complained, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. <hi>That his Iniquities were gone over his head as a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93507:148"/>
Burden too heavy for him to bear;</hi> afterwards declar'd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12. <hi>That as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far had the Lord removed his Tranſgreſſions from him:</hi> Now where did the <hi>Scriptures</hi> tell him that his Iniquities were put ſo far from him? Or how were they the Ground of this Faith by which he thus ſpoke, and by which he had this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Remiſſion or Removing of his ſins? Was not the Word, which was ſettled in the Heavens, and which was a Light to his Feet, &amp;c. the Ground of this Faith: Which Word healed him when he was in Diſtreſs, and when his Wounds ſtunk becauſe of his Folly; which Word ſtill remaineth, and is owned as the Ground of Faith for the Remiſſion of ſins, though the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be not acknowledged to be the Word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And for his ſaying, <q>It maketh void the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Faith in the precious Promiſes of God; for, what hath Faith to exerciſe it ſelf, but only the Promiſes of God in <hi>Scripture,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, The true Faith, which Chriſt is the Author of, hath the Power of God (in which it ſtands) to exerciſe it ſelf in, as the Objects thereof; through which Power of God (which is the Goſpel) Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is brought to Light, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. as Fruit of that Faith which ſtands in Chriſt the Power; ſo that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Knowledge is thereby added to the Faith, by which the true Believer is built up in his Holy Faith: ſo that denying the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the Word doth not make void the Exerciſes of Faith, nor take away the Ground in which true Faith ſtandeth, as <hi>J. N.</hi> vainly imagineth; becauſe the Scripture is not the <hi>Power of God,</hi> in which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93507:148"/>
the true Faith ſtandeth: Neither doth it follow, as <hi>J. N.</hi> aſſerteth, <hi>That Faith muſt be exercis'd in Scripture, or elſe upon Fancy and Imagination;</hi> becauſe it may be exerciſed in the Power of God, as in the true Ground thereof, which is neither Scripture, nor Imagination, nor Fancy; for the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>That his Speech and Preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wiſdom, but in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power, that their Faith might not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Man, but in the Power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 5. And in this are the Exerciſes of that true Faith, which (by the Spirit or Word) was once deliver'd to the Saints, and which we now earneſtly contend for. But <hi>J. N.</hi> by this Aſſertion ſignifies that he is a <hi>Stranger</hi> to the Power of God, in which true Faith ſtandeth, and therefore we may rationally conclude, That he is alſo Reprobate concerning that Faith which Chriſt the Power of God is the Author and Object of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He ſaith, <q>It denyeth the Comforts of Faith; for all Comforts that Faith can bring to the ſoul, muſt be brought from the Promiſes of God, according as they are laid down in the Scripture, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here <hi>J.N.</hi> abſolutely limits God, without any <hi>Ground or Reaſon, or Warrant for ſo doing;</hi> as though <hi>God,</hi> who is the Fountain of all true <hi>Comfort,</hi> could not convey true <hi>Comfort</hi> to the <hi>ſoul</hi> of a Believer by his Faith, but he muſt firſt fetch it from the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and ſo in effect the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> muſt be ſet above <hi>God,</hi> or at leaſt, in the Place of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what <hi>Scripture J. N.</hi> hath to prove this his abſurd Affirmation, I know not; he hath produced none to prove
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93507:149"/>
that, nor indeed any of the ſad Conſequences, which he ſaith will follow the denying the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and <hi>Perfect Rule, &amp;c.</hi> we have only his bare word for it; but whether that be of ſufficient authority to enduce us to believe his Aſſertions, I leave to the juditious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge; ſeeing that Chriſt ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, That the Water that he would give, ſhould be in him that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it as a Well ſpringing up to Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 4.14. &amp; again, Joh. 7.38, 39. ſaid, <hi>He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of Living Water: But this ſpake-he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi> [Mark Reader] The Spirit that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that believed on him (and whoſe Faith ſtood in the <hi>Power of God</hi>) was that Living Water that ſhould be in them ſpringing up unto Eternal Life, or that ſhould flow up in them through Faith; and this <hi>Comfort</hi> their Faith did not fetch from <hi>Scripture,</hi> but by their Faith was known to dwell in them, <hi>as their Everlaſting Comforter, that was to abide with them forever,</hi> even the Spirit of Truth, according as Chriſt promiſed, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.16, 17. ſo that to deny the Scripture to be the Word, is not to deny the <hi>Comforts</hi> of Faith, becauſe that the <hi>true Comforter</hi> was known by Faith, and is known by Faith to remain though the Scripture may be taken away; and yet it doth not deny the <hi>Comfort</hi> of the Scripture neither, unto thoſe who have the underſtanding thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, J. N.</hi> ſaith, <q>It deſtroyes the Support and Supplies of Grace to the ſoul in a time of Affliction, &amp;c. and to deny the Scriptures to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> is to deny the very Foundation and Well-ſpring of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> to the ſoul in Affliction, which is brought out of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93507:149"/>
the Promiſes in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to the ſoul, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Aſſertion is like the former, only the laſt part thereof ſomewhat more groſs Blaſphemy, without any <hi>Scripture Argument</hi> to prove any part thereof, only his own Aſſertion, as in the reſt, though full contrary to the Teſtimony of the Prophet, who ſpeaking of the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul ſaid, <hi>When the Enemy ſhall come in like a Flood the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a Standard againſt him:</hi> That was the Support and Relief of the ſoul in the time of its Affliction, according to the Prophets Teſtimony; and the ſame <hi>Support</hi> the Children of Light do ſtill witneſs, whoſe Faith ſtands in the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and whoſe Truſt is in that Name which is a <hi>ſtrong Tower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for his calling the <hi>Scriptures</hi> the very Fountain and Well-ſpring of <hi>Comforts,</hi> &amp;c. Its groſs Blaſphemy, and a Robbing of God, who is a Spirit, and who is the Fountain of all <hi>Good,</hi> whoſe Spirit (as before ſhewed) is in them that believe as a Well ſpringing up unto Eternal Life; for the <hi>Scriptures</hi> no where call themſelves the Fountain, nor have the holy Men of <hi>God</hi> ſo called them; but they teſtifie of him-who is the <hi>Fountain of all Good:</hi> Neither are they in them ſelves any where called the <hi>Well-ſpring of Comforts;</hi> but they teſtifie of the Spirit of Truth, the <hi>Comforter,</hi> that it ſhall be in them that believe, a Well ſpringing up unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: ſo that <hi>J. Newman</hi> to make good his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, if he could, Blaſphemouſly putteth the Dead Letter in the place of God, and in the place of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Spirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He ſaith, <q>It denieth the Knowledge of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God; for if the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be deny'd to be
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:93507:150"/>
the <hi>Word of God,</hi> then who knoweth what God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, &amp;c? and who knoweth what God counteth ſin and wickedneſs, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, This is in part anſwer'd already; for <hi>Enoch, &amp;c.</hi> had this Teſtimony, <hi>That he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God,</hi> Heb. 11.5. before the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written; and that Teſtimony was the <hi>Seal of Acceptance</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> which I dare affirm every true Believer will acknowledge; and this Teſtimony of Acceptance he did not receive from <hi>Scripture;</hi> for there was none; but he obtain'd it by Faith, which the Word (that was in the Beginning) was the Author of, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He that believes hath the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. by which it appears, That the Knowledge of Acceptance, or the <hi>Seal</hi> of being Well-pleaſing unto God, is not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but the Spirit of Faith.</p>
                     <p>But that <hi>J. N.</hi> and others, may ſee the <hi>Confuſion</hi> that he runs into while he is fighting againſt the Truth, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his own words in the 77th page of his <hi>Book,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with this Aſſertion; he ſaith, <q>I ſhall freely own the giving forth of his bleſſed Spirit into the Hearts of his Children, whereby they are directed into his Moſt Holy Will, by the enlightening of their ſpirits by that Holy Spirit of Promiſe, by which they know their Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and alſo, by the ſame Spirit can own God to be their Father, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far are his own words, by which the Reader may eaſily judge whether or no <hi>J-N.</hi> doth not ſpeak abſolutely contrary to the Belief or Perſwaſion of his mind, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>If the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be deny'd to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> it denieth the Knowledge of Acceptance; and who then
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93507:150"/>
knoweth what <hi>God</hi> accounteth ſin and wickedneſs, &amp;c.</q> I ſay, let the Reader but compare his <hi>Confeſſion</hi> concerning the Spirit with his Aſſertion concerning the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and he ſhall ſee his <hi>Contradition</hi> ſufficiently; for, if the giving forth of the Spirit directeth into the Knowledge of the Moſt Holy Will of the Father, then by the ſame Spirit, what is contrary to that muſt abſolutely be known alſo; and how then can it be ſaid, that without Scriptures be owned to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the Ground of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Acceptance with God is deny'd; ſeeing that which manifeſts the will of the Father, manifeſts that which is acceptable to him, and thereby its known? And all this may be known by the Spirit, as <hi>J. N.</hi> confeſſeth, to the wounding of his own Work. And indeed, What he hath acknowledged is to be known by the Spirit, is even enough for any man to know, or enough to give Satisfaction to every <hi>Soul,</hi> who breathes after the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Acceptance with God: For what can give more ſatisfaction to a man, then to know the holy Will of God by his Spirit, and to know his Adoption, and to know that God is his Father? Certainly there is no cauſe for him that hath this Knowledge to queſtion his Acceptance with God: And this may be known without Scripture, even by the holy Spirit of Promiſe, as <hi>J.N.</hi> confeſſeth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deny the Scriptures to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> doth not deny the Knowledge of Acceptance with God; and thus out of his own Mouth he is judged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He ſaith, <q>If the Scriptures be denied to be the Word of God, &amp;c. then all men are left in the dark, &amp;c. for no man is able to know that God will ſave any, but by his Word, which is contain'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93507:151"/>
for this is the Word of Salvation, or that which directeth to the Means by which we ſhall obtain Life, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That none are able to know that God will ſave any, but by this Word, that I ſhall eaſily acknowledgd; becauſe its the Word only that is able to ſave: but that the Scriptures are this Word, or alone able to ſave, that I do not acknowledge, but deny; and <hi>J. N.</hi> hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced no <hi>Proof</hi> for his Aſſertion, but only his own Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor indeed can he: although he boldly ſaith, <hi>They are the Word of Salvation,</hi> yet they no where ſay ſo of themſelves; but they teſtifie of the Word of Salvation, and <hi>That it was ſent unto the Children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and unto all amongſt them that feared God,</hi> Acts 13.26. [Mark] This was not the <hi>Scriptures</hi> that were ſent amongſt them; but the <hi>Word of Salvation,</hi> or that Word which is able to ſave, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. which the Apoſtle there beſought the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> to receive with Meekneſs, calling it the <hi>Ingrafted Word,</hi> or as ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlations have it, <hi>The Word that is grafted in you:</hi> ſo this is the <hi>Word</hi> that is able to ſave, the <hi>Word of Salvation,</hi> the <hi>Word of Faith in the Heart, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Word</hi> was in the Beginning, the Author of the Faith of the Fathers; by which <hi>Jacob</hi> knew that God would ſave, even before <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written, which made him ſay (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.18.) <hi>O Lord, I have waited for thy Salvation:</hi> By all which it appears, That to deny the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> doth not leave men ſo in the dark, as <hi>J. N.</hi> affirmeth, but that they are ſtill in a capacity to know that God will ſave; and alſo to ſee the Salvation of God, which is promiſed to them that order their <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> aright.</p>
                     <p>And whereas he ſaith, <q>That the Scriptures direct
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:93507:151"/>
to the Means by which we ſhall obtain Life.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> I ſhall eaſily acknowledge that; for, as I have before ſaid, they contain many true Teſtimonies of him, who is the alone Leader unto Life; and they are profitable for Doctrine, for Inſtruction, &amp;c. that people may be directed to Chriſt the Way, which they teſtifie of; and that they may be turned from Darkneſs to the Light, which diſcovers the Darkneſs; and that they may come to receive with Meekneſs the ingrafted Word, or the word which is grafted in them, by it to be taught, and led unto the Poſſeſſion of Life; for this is the Means by which Life is obtain'd, which the Scriptures teſtifie of, and direct unto; and for this Work we own the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be profitable.</p>
                     <p>But this doth not run paralel with the Affirmation of <hi>J. N.</hi> in the 24th page of his <hi>Book,</hi> where he affirmeth, <q>That Life was in the Scriptures; for its one thing to ſay, that there is Life therein; and another thing to ſay, they direct to the Means by which Life is obtain'd.</q> If <hi>John Newman</hi> aſſerted no other thing then the latter, there had been no Controverſie about this Point; for, ſo far we own the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> But his Confuſion ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what his ſpirit is, oft-tmes contradicting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf, as is uſual with thoſe that oppoſe the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Truth.</p>
                     <p>But I perceive, an Objection may ariſe in the Ignorant concerning this thing, <hi>That if the Word which is able to ſave, be grafted in people, and be nigh unto all, even in the Heart and Mouth; why then are not all ſaved? or, why do not all ſee the Salvation of God? or, why did the Apoſtle Exhort them to receive it with Meekneſs, if it were in them already?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:93507:152"/>I Anſwer, though the Word, or Spirit, (which is one) was in them, yet they being diſobedient thereunto, did not receive it, or had not received it; but had alwayes reſiſted it, as the Apoſtle tells them, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. and ſo were like unto thoſe that <hi>Job</hi> ſpoke of, ſaying; <hi>They are of them that rebel againſt the Light, who know not the Way of it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 24.13. ſo that although the Word, or Light, or Spirit be in a people, and they rebel againſt it, or reſiſt the reproofs and Inſtructions thereof, or do diſpite to the ſtrivings thereof; how can ſuch be ſaid to have received it, for they only receive the Word, and the Spirit, that receive the Reproofs and Inſtructions thereof, and in them it is known to be a Spirit, or Prince of Peace, and a Word of Life, and Conſolation, and ſuch know their Beloved to lye all might betwixt their Breſts; but although he be nigh even in the hearts of many, they cannot be ſaid to receive him, while they rebel againſt him; and therefore they are not ſaved, but condemned by him; <hi>For this is the condemnation that Light is come, and men love Darkneſs rather then Light, Joh.</hi> 3.19. and though he lighteth every man that comes into the World; yet its only they that receive him, (the Light) that he gives Power unto, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. by which it appears that all that were englightned by him, did not receive him, ſo that the Light, the Word; the Spirit, may be in people, and yet they that received it, but reject it in its Reproofs, Counſels, and Inſtructions, and therefore they are not ſaved by it, but condemned; for which cauſe it was needful for the Apoſtle to Labour to turn them from Darkneſs to the Light, wherewith they were enlightned, &amp; to Exhort them to receive with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the engrafted Word, or to ſubmit unto the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93507:152"/>
of the Word that was in them, that by it they might be ſaved; for none experimentally knows its ability to ſave, but they, who receive the Reproofs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of it, and are Doers, or Obeyers thereof; and ſuch are taught thereby (as by the Univerſal Grace, which hath appeared unto all men, which bringeth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to order their Converſation aright, through which they come to ſee the great Salvation of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Now I come to the eighth, ſad Conſequence that <hi>J.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by what God counteth Unclean, and what Holy, he meaneth the things appertaining to the Life and Converſation of People, then the denial of <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God</hi> doth not hinder People from knowing what is Unclean and what is Holy: Notwithſtanding, we cannot own the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the Word; yet we own that to be unclean which is ſo accounted in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of Truth in the Goſpel Diſpenſation, and that to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which in them is ſo accounted, and that the one ought to be choſen and the other refuſed: but if there were no <hi>Scriptures in beeing,</hi> yet are people in the ſame capacity to receive the Knowledge of thoſe things, as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written; or as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were, who had not the outward Law, yet in Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhewed forth the Works of the Law that was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Hearts; and if thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> were now here,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93507:153"/>
they would condemn the Ignorance of <hi>J. N.</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Without Scripture none know whether there be a God, or what he counteth Unclean, and what Holy:</hi> For all the <hi>Heathen Poets</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who had not the Scriptures, generally acknowledged a Supream Power and Beeing, which all were to be ſubject to, ſome calling of it by one name, and ſome another; but while they acknowledged the thing, it is ſufficient to ſignifie, that if the Scriptures were not in beeing, yet People might know that there is a <hi>God:</hi> And they are not only in the capacity that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were, who knew and confeſſed, <hi>That there was a God, and ſhew'd forth the Works of the Law written in their Hearts;</hi> but alſo, in the capacity that the Fathers of old were; who did not only know that there was a <hi>God,</hi> but knew the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true <hi>God,</hi> and were the acceptable Worſhippers of him before Scriptures were written.</p>
                     <p>And theſe things I ſpeak not in the leaſt to under-value the Scriptures, or out of a ſlight eſteem of them; for they are very profitable for Inſtruction, &amp;c. and ſo I own them, and have great eſteem of them; yet if people have no more Knowledge then what they carnally receive therefrom, I may ſay as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>That what they know, they know naturally, as bruit Beaſts; and indeed, knew nothing as they ought to know:</hi> And thoſe that he thus ſpake to had the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that were then in beeing; yet had not the Knowledge of God, which he ſpoke to their ſhame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. So that the End of my thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, to enduce people not to reſt in a <hi>Notional</hi> or <hi>Traditional Knowledge</hi> concerning <hi>God,</hi> which is fecht in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Comprehenſion out of <hi>Scripture</hi> by the Wiſdom that is from below; but that all may encline unto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Almighty, which giveth Knowledge, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93507:153"/>
wait in the Light which ſhineth in the Darkneſs; or take heed unto the Word in the Heart, as unto a Light that ſhines in a Dark place, until the Day-ſtar ariſe there, that will expel the Darkneſs, by which the Underſtanding hath been clouded; and until the Light ſhine out of the Darkneſs, which gives the Knowledge of the glory God in the Face of Chriſt Jeſus: And this is that Knowledge which is ſaving, and is of concernment for all to come to; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (whatſoever notional Knowledge they have) they that have not the Knowledge of God, ſhall be puniſhed with Everlaſting Deſtruction from his Preſence, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>

                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> And Laſtly, <hi>J. N.</hi> ſaith, <q>That to deny the Scriptures to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. is to leave men to walk by Fancy or Imagination, leaving that holy Rule, wherein Life and Salvation is declar'd, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is but like the reſt <hi>(viz.)</hi> His own Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without farther Proof: But whether denying the Scriptures to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> be to deny them to be believed, as containing true Teſtimonies concerning the Word (for ſo I have alwayes owned them) I may leave to the Reader to judge; and how it leaves men to walk by Fancy or Imagination (while <hi>J. N.</hi> himſelf ſaith, <hi>That the Bleſſed Spirit directeth into the Knowledge of the moſt holy Will of the Father, and that thereby the Adoption is known, and God owned, &amp;c.</hi>) ſeems very ſtrange; for, the Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reproves all Imaginations and Fancies, and leads into all Truth thoſe who receive the Reproofs and Inſtructions thereof: And therefore the denying of the Scripture to be the Word, while the Word in the Heart (which the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:93507:154"/>
Scripture teſtifieth of) is owned; people are not left to walk by Imagination, but by the Word, which is a Light to the Feet of thoſe who take heed unto their Wayes, according to the leadings of it: And the Help and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that is to be found in the Scriptures People are not depriv'd of neither, though they are not owned to be the Word: So that <hi>J. N.</hi> hereby and others, may ſee plainly that thoſe ſad conſequences do not follow the denying the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and Rule, &amp;c. as <hi>J. N.</hi> vainly imagin'd, and boldly without Proof affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And what do all thoſe Affirmations ſignifie more then this, That <hi>J. Newman</hi> (for all his large Profeſſion of Knowledge and Underſtanding) is ignorant of the Holy Spirit, Power and Word of God, without which none can be born again? And ſo himſelf is found in the Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate-ſtate, and worſhipping according to the oldneſs of the Letter; a Blind Leader of the Blind, which all are to beware of; for its ſuch that lead people captive laden with Sins and divers Luſts, alwayes learning, but never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, which ſets free, and which ſanctifieth, which is the Word, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. but labours to keep them from enclining to the ſanctifying Word, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet declared ſhould be their Teacher, which their Ears would hear behind, ſaying, <hi>This is the Way, walk in it;</hi> when they turn to the Right-Hand, or to the left, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21.</p>
                     <p>And thus having briefly gone through with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Scriptures and Arguments produced by him, to prove the Scriptures to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and <hi>Perfect Rule, &amp;c.</hi> and with the ſad Conſequences which he affirmed would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by denying of them ſo to be: I ſhall leave it to the

Reader to judge, 1ſt, Whether the Word, ſo oft ſpoken of, as before, may be underſtood to be the Scripture? or 2dly, Whether that Word may not be underſtood to be that which was before the Scriptures were written, which ſo oft-times came unto the Prophets, by vertue of which they gave forth the Scriptures? and 3dly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rule of the New Covenant be the Scriptures, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the New Teſtament? or 4thly, Whether the Rule of the New Teſtament be not the Law written in the Heart, even the Law of that Spirit which the Apoſtle ſaid was the New Teſtament? and 5thly, Whether thoſe ſad Conſequences do follow by denying the Scriptures to be the Word, or no, as <hi>J.

                     <head>Concerning Chriſt being the Word of God.</head>
                     <p>AND now I ſhall come to the next thing which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon, which is, <hi>Chriſt being the Word of God;</hi> in which I obſerve he will own, <hi>That he is call'd ſo, but he is not really ſo,</hi> pag. 49. <hi>and that he is call'd by many Names comparatively, as a Door, a Vine, an Enſign, a Star, a Lamb, &amp;c. but yet he is not really any of theſe,</hi> pag. 50.</p>
                     <p>Anſw. What abſurdities are here? might not <hi>J.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93507:155"/>
                        <hi>John Newman</hi> ſaith he was? For <hi>J. N.</hi> altogether contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts Chriſt's ſayings in Scripture concerning himſelf; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am the True Vine;</hi> But <hi>J. N.</hi> ſaith, in the 50. Pag of his Book: <hi>he is not a Vine.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greateſt Truth that I can perceive demonſtrated in this matter, is, <hi>That J. N. is no Branch of the True Vine, nor yet grafted into it;</hi> for if he had been a Branch in the Vine (or a member in the Body that holds the Head) he would have known that Chriſt is really a Vine; and he would have alſo known that he is really all thoſe things which he ſaid of himſelf, and which they that knew what he was to them, ſaid of him; and that it is by the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the Operations of this one Lord, that he is known to be really all thoſe things, but <hi>J. N.</hi> hath ſufficiently declared himſelf to be a ſtranger to the diverſities of the operations of this one Lord, by denying him to be really what he affirmeth himſelf to be; and ſo hath given Chriſt the Lye, of which let him repent, before it be to late.</p>
                     <p>But what's the cauſe that he thus works, and ſhuffles, and denys Chriſt before men, to be what he ſaid he was, and what they that knew the diverſities of his operations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd him to be? is it not to take away the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, to hinder them from going in at this Door, that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering? is it not to keep people from believing, that the operation of the Word in the Heart (which is a Hammer knocking for reſception) is the appearance of Chriſt, leſt they ſhould be converted thereto, by its own operation, and thereby be healed of all their putrifying ſores? and is not this to do the Divel's work, to ſhut Chriſt and his ſaving Power out of his People, as though he whom the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>aſcended far above all Heavens that he might fill all things,</hi> could be circumſcribed onely to a Body of Fleſh?
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93507:155"/>
[Mark] he did not only ſay, that <hi>he aſcended into Heaven;</hi> neither do I deny, (but acknowledge) that <hi>he ſits at the right Hand of God in Heaven:</hi> But he alſo ſaid, <hi>that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things:</hi> And becauſe he fills all things, therefore <hi>None need ſay, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven to fetch Chriſt from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep to fetch him up, &amp;c? for the Word is nigh unto thee in thy Mouth; and in thy Heart, which is incomprehenſible, and filleth all things;</hi> ſo that all may look unto him and be ſaved, even to the Word, which is really the Word, and is able to ſave the Soul even to the uttermoſt from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatſoever; but <hi>J. N.</hi> would not have this Word to be properly Chriſt, by any means, but ſhifts, and ſhuffles, and wreſts the Scripture; and brings in his Meanings, as though they were of more credit, then the plain words of Scripture; and would fain put out our Eyes with his Atoms: But in the true Light, which makes all things manifeſt, he is ſeen, comprehended and denyed to be any true Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Chriſt, or Branch of the true Vine, or ſpiritual Worſhipper.</p>
                     <p>But then (in the 50. Page of his Book) where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, <q>that Chriſt is not really the Word; though ſo called <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> there is an objection brought againſt this Truth in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. where the Evangeliſt ſaith; <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the</hi> word was God; from whence <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> they object, and ſay, <hi>That Chriſt was the Word from the beginning;</hi> which thing <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> I cannot grant; for this place doth not prove, Chriſt, as Chriſt, to be the Word from the beginning; but it proveth the Word to be God from the beginning, for Chriſt was not Chriſt in the beginning, but the Word was God in the beginning; but Chriſt was in time, when the God head had taken Fleſh to it ſelf, and not before, &amp;c.</q>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:93507:156"/>
And in pag. 51. he ſaith, <q>It cannot be underſtood, that Chriſt, as Chriſt, ſhould be the Word of God, from, or in the beginning; or yet called the Word of God; for he was not Chriſt till he took to himſelf Fleſh in the Womb of <hi>Mary;</hi> therefore Chriſt, as Chriſt, could not be the Word of God from the beginning.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mark Reader, whether or no the Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>J.

But <hi>J.

                     <p>Again, The Apoſtle ſaid (by vertue of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Father) <hi>That Chriſt was the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 16.16, 17. <hi>Thou art the Son of God:</hi> And this Chriſt the Son of God, <hi>was glorified with the Father before the World was:</hi> For that was Chriſt that ſaid, <hi>Glorifie thy Son with the ſame Glory that he had with thee, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore Chriſt was Chriſt before the World was, and before he took to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>And whereas <hi>J. N.</hi> ſaith; <hi>He cannot grant that Chriſt was the Word from the Beginning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That doth not at all weaken the Teſtimony of <hi>John,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>The Word was with God in the Beginning;</hi> for his Teſtimony doth as much prove, <hi>That Christ was the Word in the Beginning,</hi> as it doth, <hi>That the Word was God;</hi> and <hi>J.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93507:156"/>
being a <hi>Stranger</hi> to the Spirit that giveth Underſtanding, and being gone from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which elſewhere he ſeems ſo much to applaud) into his own Imaginations and Fancies; for ſaith he, <hi>He was not Christ till he took to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Fleſh;</hi> and he that took to himſelf Fleſh, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth <hi>to be the Word,</hi> by which he confeſſed, <hi>Chriſt was the Word before he took Fleſh;</hi> by which alſo in effect he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, <hi>That the Fleſh that he took in the Womb of the Virgin, was not Chriſt, but the Fleſh that Chriſt took;</hi> thus much his own words import; but I know he will not like to hear of it, becauſe it ſo deeply woundeth his own Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And ſo after <hi>J. N.</hi> hath rumbled through many Non-ſenſical Arguments, labouring thereby to prove, <hi>That Christ is not really the Word of God, but only comparatively ſo call'd, &amp;c.</hi> he findeth another Objection in p. 56. brought againſt his Affirmation, <q>And is (ſaith he) in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Being born again, not of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever:</hi> Which <hi>Word,</hi> ſaith the Objector, is Chriſt; and the great Reaſon that is urged, is, <hi>Becauſe it liveth and abideth forever:</hi> But <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> theſe words make nothing to prove this <hi>Word</hi> here to be Chriſt; for <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith in verſ. 25. <hi>The Word of the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth forever; and this is the Word which by the Goſpel is preached unto you.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>(And from hence</hi> J. N. <hi>argueth)</hi> 
                        <q>That the Preachings of the Apoſtles according to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> was that <hi>Word</hi> by which they were born again, and which endureth forever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, as ſometime before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93507:157"/>
                        <hi>occaſion</hi> have ſaid, There is a difference betwixt the the Thing Preached, and the Preachings of the Thing; and betwixt the Thing Witneſſed or Teſtified of, and the Teſtimony or Witneſs concerning the Thing: So that although the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> by the <hi>Goſpel, (which is the Power of God)</hi> preached the Word, and preached Chriſt; yet the Preachings or Declarations of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> cannot properly be called Chriſt, <hi>who is without beginning of Dayes or end of Life;</hi> nor can they properly be call'd the <hi>Word,</hi> which abideth forever; and ſo cannot be concluded to be that by which they were born again: This Shift will not ſerve the turn of <hi>J. N.</hi> to perſwade us, <hi>That the Word which the Apoſtle preached was not Chriſt, or that Christ was not that Word by which they were born again;</hi> for, when ever he preached the <hi>Word</hi> he preach'd Chriſt; and yet his Preachings were neither the <hi>Word</hi> preached, nor yet Chriſt; but Chriſt preached was the <hi>Word</hi> by which they were born again, which liveth and abideth forever, as is evident by the Scripture before mention'd, which proves a Block too heavy for <hi>J. N.</hi> to remove out of his way.</p>
                     <p>Again, In pag. 57. he ſaith, <q>This Word cannot be underſtood of Chriſt, becauſe it is here called the Seed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet it may be underſtood of Chriſt, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be rightly underſtood of Chriſt; becauſe, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Seed is Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, In pag. 58. he ſaith thus, <q>Neither do I go about to rob Chriſt of his Title, but do acknowledge him to be called the <hi>Word of God</hi> comparatively, as
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93507:157"/>
he is the Father's Mouth, and ſpeaketh the Father's words, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hereby we may perceive that <hi>J. N.</hi> will not own Chriſt to be the <hi>Word,</hi> no more then in effect he owns the Prophets and Apoſtles to be the Word; for he owns Chriſt to be the Word but comparatively, and not really ſo, and but as he is the Father's Mouth to ſpeak the Father Words, and ſo were the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles the Father's Mouth, and ſpoke his words, as the Spirit gave them utterance: So that if he was called the Word only becauſe of that, every one of the Prophets may be as well called the Word alſo, becauſe they were his Mouth, and ſpoke his words.</p>
                     <p>But what Abſurdities are theſe, that <hi>J. N.</hi> runs into, to make Chriſt not to be the Word, really ſo? I muſt needs acknowledge he exceeds (in one thing) all ſorts of People profeſſing Chriſtianity, that ever I ſpoke with, or heard of; for I never heard of any, nor ſpoke with any, but would acknowledge Chriſt to be really the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Word, though they will (many of them) plead for the Scripture to be the <hi>Word</hi> (or as ſome ſtile it, <hi>the Material Word</hi>) alſo: But <hi>J. N.</hi> affirms the Scriptures to be properly and principally the <hi>Word,</hi> and Chriſt but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively the <hi>Word,</hi> and not really ſo: So that he out-ſtrips all (in promoting the Scriptures, and in under-valuing Chriſt) that ever I heard of; and it is not his wreſting of Scriptures, and jumbling his own Intepretations and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations amongſt them, that will effect his Deſign, or will prove Chriſt not to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> really ſo; nor yet to be Chriſt before he took Fleſh, &amp;c. For the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of himſelf, and of his Servants concerning him, (which <hi>J. N.</hi> by his Imaginations labours to make of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93507:158"/>
none effect) will ſtand valuable and credible, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt, who (as <hi>J. Newman</hi> confeſſeth) took Fleſh in the Womb of the Virgin, was the <hi>Word</hi> with God in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and that the <hi>Rock</hi> which follow'd <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Chriſt, before he took Fleſh; and that this <hi>Word</hi> which by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> the Apoſtle preached, was Chriſt which he preached; and that the preachings, declarations, or words of the Apoſtles were not the Word preached; and that the <hi>Word preached</hi> (and not the Preachings of it) was that by which they were born again, and which lived forever; and that the true Chriſt was the Son glorified with the Father before the <hi>World</hi> was, and is without Beginning of Dayes or End of Life; the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and his <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> alſo; the Firſt and the Laſt, the Beginning and the End, and the Joy of many Generations; the Quickening Spirit that dwells in his People; the expreſs Image of the Father's Subſtance, whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain, who is aſcended far above all Heavens that he might fill <hi>all things,</hi> who is the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend; and he that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear.</p>

                     <p>THe next thing he undertakes, is, (pag. 60.) to prove that the true Chriſt doth not dwell in any man, as he is Chriſt, but inſtead of ſo doing, he goes about to prove, that the Body of the true Chriſt, that he took upon him, and in which he ſuffered, roſe again out of the

                     <p>But what!

Might he not as well have ſaid, <hi>That he cannot be in the Boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (as <hi>John</hi> teſtified, cap. 1. verſ. 18.) <hi>becauſe he ſits at his Right-hand,</hi> as ſay, he cannot be in man, becauſe he is there? Or might he not as well have ſaid, He cannot be at the Right-hand of the Father, becauſe he is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>Boſom?</hi> For, by what he hath ſaid, he appears to exclude him out of his People (who is the Image of the Father, which the Heaven of Heavens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) and to confine him only to a <hi>Body of Flesh;</hi> though the Apoſtle ſaid plainly, <hi>That he aſcended far above all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that he might fill all things,</hi> Eph. 4.10. by which it may plainly be underſtood, That his being at the Right-hand of the Father, and in the <hi>Boſom</hi> of the Father, doth no way hinder his being in man; but as he is at the Right-hand of the Father, and in the <hi>Boſom</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo he is in man alſo: And they that know not this Chriſt in them, they are Reprobates, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                     <p>Again, In pag. 65. of his <hi>Book</hi> he ſaith thus, <q>If he did aſcend as Jeſus, or a Saviour, then he had a <hi>Body</hi> of Fleſh; for he was not Jeſus, or a Saviour, as he was God, but as he was Man</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That he aſcended as he was Jeſus and a Saviour, I own; but it doth not therefore follow, <hi>That God was not a Saviour;</hi> for, although <hi>J. N.</hi> boldly and blaſphemouſly
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:93507:159"/>
affirmeth (without any <hi>Proof,</hi> as his uſual manner is) that he was not a Saviour as he was God, but as he was man: Yet it is eaſie to prove the contrary; becauſe the Word which was with God in the beginning, and which was God, is able to ſave; and therefore is a Saviour as he is God, and alſo as the Word manifeſted in the Fleſh (the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who is God's Salvation) for the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Names doth not add to his Ability, but to expreſs his Dignity, and the diverſity of his Operations, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Names hath been given him; and yet ſtill is the ſame Lord under either of theſe Names, or in either of his Operations, whom the Prophet ſaid ſhould come forth of <hi>Bethlehem Ephratah,</hi> to be Ruler in <hi>Iſrael, VVhoſe Goings forth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have been from of Old, from Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Mich. 5.2. [Mark] Is not Chriſt he that is to be Ruler in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And is it not he that is the Saviour? Then the Goings-forth of the Saviour have been from of Old, even from Everlaſting; therefore he is a Saviour as he is God, and was ſo before he took Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>And if this be too little to give ſatisfaction, That he is a Saviour as he is God, or that he was a Saviour before he took upon him Fleſh, then take farther the ſayings of God himſelf by his Prophets (and if you will not hear them, you will not hear though one ariſe from the Dead) Hoſea 13.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt know no God but Me; for there is no Saviour beſides Me:</hi> And again, In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.11. he ſaith, <hi>I, even I, am the Lord; and beſides Me there is no Saviour:</hi> By all which it appears ſufficiently that he is a Saviour, as he is God; and that his aſcending as a Saviour doth not prove that either the Spirit (or God) was not the Saviour, or that the Fleſh ſimply was the Saviour; becauſe it appears he was a Saviour before he took Fleſh upon him; and is Chriſt the ſame this day as yeſterday, and the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93507:160"/>
the Spirit that quickeneth; <hi>For the Fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> as Chriſt himſelf ſaid, and therefore can be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Joh. 6.63.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.21, 22. he ſaith, <hi>There is no God elſe beſides me, a juſt God, and a Saviour; look unto me, and be ye ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. [Mark Reader,] beſide the <hi>Saviour</hi> there is <hi>no God,</hi> as ſaith God himſelf by the Prophet; ſo that if the affima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>J. N.</hi> and other ſuch Profeſſors be true; <hi>That the body of Fleſh that Chriſt took (which in Scripture is called the body of Jeſus) be the onely Saviour;</hi> then the Prophets Words muſt be falſe, or elſe, there muſt be no God, but the <hi>Body of Fleſh,</hi> becauſe, <hi>there is no God elſe but the Saviour,</hi> as ſaid God; But to ſay, <hi>There is no God, but that body of Fleſh that the Word took,</hi> would be groſs and horrid Blaſphemy; but ſuch is the effect of the Affirmation of <hi>J. N.</hi> by which he may ſee his Ignorance, Preſumption and Blaſphemy; and this may ſuffice forever to ſtop the Mouthes of thoſe who affirm <hi>the body of Fleſh that Chriſt took, to be the Saviour,</hi> and do deny him to be <hi>a Saviour as he is God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that all may be informed where to look unto him (according to the exhortation of the Prophet) and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, obſerve what the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith, Chap. 4. verſ. 13. <hi>he that declareth unto man what is his thought, the God of Hoſts is his Name,</hi> and (Jer. 17.10.) <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart, &amp;c.</hi> by which thou mayeſt underſtand that this is God the Saviour, and Chriſt the quickening Spirit (<hi>for Chriſt is God,</hi> Rom. 9.5.) that ſearcheth thy Heart, and ſheweth thee thy thoughts; though thou haſt thought him to be ſuch an one as thy ſelf, and haſt ſet him at a diſtance in thy Imaginations; yet he is near at Hand unto thee, (the Word in thy Heart, who is a Searcher thereof; and a Diſcerner of thy thoughts, which he ſhews unto thee)
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93507:160"/>
that ſo thou mayſt look unto him, to be led and inſtructed by his good Spirit of Grace, <hi>which bringeth Salvation unto Light in all who are taught thereby to order their Converſation aright, Pſal.</hi> 50.13. and this is that free Grace <hi>which hath appeared unto all men,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. by which the primative <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were taught (as by a ſtanding Rule, according to which they walked) And by which, <hi>through Faith they were ſaved,</hi> as the Apoſtle teſtified <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. though many turned from this Grace into Wantonneſs, and did diſpite to the Spirit thereof, as they do at this day; And thoſe are they that Rebel againſt the Light wherewith every one is enlightned, and labours to render it inſufficient to ſave; not conſidering that this is that Grace that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all, and by which they were ſaved, and which God ſaid unto <hi>Paul, was Sufficient for him;</hi> and ſo they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot, that blood of the everlaſting Covenant, which is Drink indeed, by which they that walk in the Light are clenſed from all ſin.</p>
                     <p>But then he ſaith (in page 68.) <q>There is an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought againſt him from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though he had known Chriſt after the Fleſh, yet henceforth know I him ſo no more.</hi>
                        </q> But in page 70. he ſaith. <q>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is ſo far from denying to know Chriſt in a <hi>Body of Fleſh,</hi> though Glorified, that he doth affirm the ſame to the Church of the <hi>Epheſians, Eph.</hi> 5.30. where he ſaith, <hi>We are Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone:</hi> but <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not intend to know Chriſt in the Fleſh at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all thoſe Infirmities as he was ſubject to in his ſuffering Eſtate.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by the Body of Fleſh that Chriſt had, he means the Church which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of, which was
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93507:161"/>
the <hi>Body</hi> of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Word</hi>) was Head, and they Members of, then I am one with him; for, his having that <hi>Body</hi> (after his Aſcention) I never deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor intend to do ſo: but that <hi>Body</hi> could not be call'd the Saviour; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Saviour of that <hi>Body,</hi> of which they were Members, was yet on Earth: And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was not without expectation of the ſame Sufferings (in meaſure) to attend <hi>Chriſt</hi> in thoſe Members of his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as had attended him before; for, in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. he ſaith thus, <hi>Who now Rejoyce in my Suffering for you, and fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his Body's ſake, which is the Church;</hi> by which it appears, that Afflictions did ſtill attend thoſe Members of <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi> who (as J. N. confeſſeth) <hi>was Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone:</hi> And ſuch a <hi>Body</hi> we own <hi>Chriſt</hi> had after his Aſcenſion, and ſtill hath, though not free (as yet) from ſuffering Afflictions; yet his <hi>Body</hi> ſhall be faſhioned like unto his glorious <hi>Body;</hi> which is not ſo confined, as he vainly imagins they were Fleſh of his Fleſh, &amp;c. This doth not in the leaſt prove that Chriſt is not in man, but rather the contrary; for can it be rationally concluded, that he ſhould be at a diſtance from the Members of his own <hi>Body?</hi> No certainly: If the <hi>Body</hi> be divided from the <hi>Head,</hi> it is no more a perfect <hi>Body,</hi> but dead <hi>Members:</hi> So that Chriſt, the Head (the Quickening Spirit) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men to be Members of his <hi>Body,</hi> of his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and of his <hi>Bone,</hi> we may rationally conclude (if we had no other Evidence) That he is not at a diſtance from his <hi>Body,</hi> but preſent with them, and therefore in them, as himſelf ſaid, Joh. 14.17. <hi>He is with you,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be in you:</hi> And in verſe 20. <hi>At that day you ſhall know that I am in my Father</hi> [Mark, in the Boſom of the Father] <hi>and you in me, and I in you.</hi>

                     <p>[Mark Reader] I would not be miſtaken, but rightly <hi>underſtood</hi> in this matter, it being a matter of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

weight and moment: I do not oppoſe the Beeing of God and Chriſt out of man, in the <hi>higheſt Heavens,</hi> nor in the <hi>loweſt Hell,</hi> becauſe Infinite and Incorruptible; but his ſo being diſtinct, as to exclude his Nature and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from man, thereby denying his In-dwelling, is the thing which I oppoſe (and which <hi>J.

                     <p>Again, If the Spirit be God, as <hi>J.

the reaſons he gives is, becauſe the Scriptures are the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings forth of the Spirit; and yet notwithſtanding will ſay, <hi>Chriſt hath a diſtinct beeing from his Spirit, which is of his givings forth; and thus,</hi> as fancy leads him, he affirms things, as in Page 43. he ſaith, <hi>If Scripture be denyed to be the Word of God, it maketh void the exerciſe of Faith, for Faith muſt be exerciſed in the Scriptures or elſe upon fancy and imagination;</hi> and in Page 73. he ſaith, <hi>if there be no perſonal beeing of Chriſt, then there is no Chriſt to exerciſe Faith in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> ſo by this kind of Arguments of <hi>J. N.</hi> if Faith be exerciſed in <hi>a perſonal being of Chriſt,</hi> its exerciſed upon <hi>fancy and imagination,</hi> (which is very true) for a perſonal beeing of Chriſt is not Scripture, and he ſaith, <hi>Faith muſt be exerciſed in Scripture or elſe upon fancy and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> But the truth is, he cannot tell what the true Faith is nor what it is exerciſed in, ſometimes <hi>Scripture is the only thing;</hi> and another while <hi>a perſonal beeing of Chriſt;</hi> and what will it be next, <hi>but even what his Fancy and Imaginations bring forth?</hi> which he appears full of, like one that knows not Chriſt the Power of God, (manifeſted in him) who is the <hi>Author of true Faith,</hi> or the <hi>begetter thereof;</hi> and is alſo the <hi>object thereof,</hi> in which it is exerciſed, and in whom it ſtands, whom all muſt hear, that receive the true Faith, which is the victory that overcometh the World, and which giveth acceſs unto God; in which Faith, there is Peace, and Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory.</p>
                     <p>Again, in Page 87. mentioning that Scripture which ſeems as a Block in his way, which I perceive he would fain remove, (Gal. 4.19) <hi>till Chriſt be formed in you;</hi> and therefore gives this meaning, viz. <hi>This forming of Chriſt in the Saints, was but to bring them forth into a Goſpel-Purity,</hi> &amp;c. this is his Interpretation of that Scripture, and a very favorable one too; but whereby ſhould they be brought forth into a Goſpel Purity? Was it not by the Spirit's operation that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93507:163"/>
was in them, which they received by the hearing of Faith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. which <hi>J. N.</hi> acknowledged to be of the ſame beeing of the Father and the Son? If ſo, then was not Chriſt, according to Meaſure, (who fills all things) really in them, who hath diverſity of operations, who came for judgment, and to ſend Fire on the Earth; and were they not to be brought forth into that Goſpel Purity (that <hi>J. N.</hi> ſpeaks of) by his Spirit of judgment and of burning which they had received, who came for judgment, and to ſend Fire; ſeeing God ſignified by his Prophet, that <hi>the Filth of the Daughter of</hi> Sion <hi>ſhould be purged away with the Spirit of judgment and of burning?</hi> Iſa. 4.4. and this was that Spirit, by which the Saints were waſhed, cleanſed, ſanctified, and juſtified, when the Apoſtle told them they were ſo, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor. 6.11. and they that were thus waſhed, and brought forth into this Goſpel Purity, they were made a Habitation for God (who as <hi>J. N.</hi> Confeſſeth, is that Spirit) even through the Spirit's operations, which is of the ſame Being or Subſtance with Chriſt, ſo that the filth being purged away; there was room for him to dwell there, and ſo was really in them formed; and they brought forth in his own Image by his own operation, with whom the Apoſtles were Co-workers, and therefore travelled for this forming of Chriſt in them, or for the ſubjecting them in the Faith, wholly unto Chriſt's Goverment, that he might raign in them over all, who is God Bleſſed forever.</p>
                     <p>One thing more (which I find in the cloſe of his <hi>Book,</hi> which he entitules, <hi>A Caution to all)</hi> I cannot well paſs by with ſilence, where he ſaith, <q>Seeing God has caſt

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. [Mark Reader]</hi> Is it contrary to Truth's intent, to own the <hi>Truth</hi> to be a <hi>Myſtery</hi> within man?

                     <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>Let us labour with God, for his bleſſed Spirit, to guide us in all Truth.</hi> He therein ſeems to own <hi>Truth</hi> to be a Myſtery within alſo; for if the Spirit be to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, it muſt be within; and the Spirit is Truth, becauſe (as <hi>J.

                        <q>But (then ſaith <hi>J.N.</hi>) the moſt dangerous ſpirit is this, that draws all the Happineſs of this Life, and that which is to come, into man, <hi>and finiſhes all the Glory of man at the brink of the Grave.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by the <hi>Glory of man,</hi> he means <hi>the Glory of Man, as ſimply a Creature;</hi> then I do ſay, <hi>all that is to be finiſh'd at the brink of the Grave;</hi> for its <hi>but the glory of Fleſh,</hi> which, <hi>as the Flower of the Graſs, paſſeth away:</hi> But if by the <hi>Glory of man,</hi> he means that which the Wiſe in Heart ſhall inherit (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.35.) and which is the Reward of thoſe, before whom the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God goeth; then I know none (except <hi>Athieſts</hi> and <hi>Ranters</hi>) that <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>aſſert</hi> any ſuch thing; and I ſay alſo, <hi>that is the moſt dangerous</hi> ſpirit <hi>of all, and to be ſhun'd by all:</hi> But that ſpirit which would keep people out of an Expectation of ſeeing and beholding that Glory that is endleſs, while on <hi>this ſide the Grave,</hi> is not much inferior (as to the Ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it) to the other; for that would deprive people of the chief Happineſs of this Life, and of the happy Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Glory which their <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> is full of in believing, while they remain on this ſide the <hi>Grave;</hi> and may alſo endanger to deprive them of the enjoyment of that which is to be receiv'd in the Life that is to come: For, if the Earneſt of the incorruptible Inheritance (which is a part thereof) be not receiv'd in this Life, what true Comfort can there be enjoy'd in this Life? So then that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, or Word of Grace, which manifeſts its Light and Strength in the Inward Parts, by its own Operation, for the begetting of Faith in, and concerning it ſelf, in all

that hear and receive it; this, I ſay, is not to be ſhunn'd, but adhered unto by all, <hi>as unto the Author of true Faith;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, and hearing by the Word of God; and the Word is nigh thee, in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth, Rom.</hi> 10.17. and the Spirit is in the inward parts (which with the Word is one) by which Faith is given.</p>
                     <p>And all that hear this Word, and obey this Spirit of Faith, ſhall doubtleſs behold the <hi>Glory of the Word,</hi> as the Apoſtles did, even as the <hi>Glory of the only Begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth;</hi> and ſhall doubtleſs know that Faith, in which is Peace and Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory; and this will be unto them an Earneſt of the Everlaſting Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, that never fades, by which they will be aſſured of the full Poſſeſſion thereof, when time ſhall be no more.</p>
                     <p>And thus having examin'd the principal matters in this Book, <hi>viz. Concerning the Scriptures being the Word of God, and the perfect Rule, and the ſad Conſequences which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>will follow the denying of them ſo to be; and concerning Christ being the Word really ſo, and</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>but comparatively ſo; and concerning Chriſt being a Saviour as he is God, or a Saviour only, as he hath a Body of Fleſh; and concerning his being in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Father, at his Right-hand, and his being in man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo;</hi> I ſay, having gone through with theſe things, and ſpoken as to them; I ſhall leave them to the Judgement of the Judicious Reader; deſiring of God, by his own Spirit to give a right Underſtanding unto all that deſire after him, that they may know him that is true to be manifeſted in them, that they may by his ſpirit be baptized into him to live and have their <hi>Beeing</hi> in him; that ſo they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the things that appertain to his Kingdom, and to their own everlaſting Peace; <hi>that in the Faith of the Unchangable
